Acknowledgments
Writing a book is difficult business, especially a book on programming. It is 
impossible to know how to do everything in a particular language, and everyone learns 
something from the programming community. I have learned a multitude of things from 
the FreeBasic community and I want to send my thanks to all of those who have taken 
the time to post answers and examples to questions.
I would also like to say a big thanks to the developers of FreeBasic. Without your 
continual hard work in development, we wouldn’t have what I consider the premier Open 
Source BASIC language for today.
The PDF version of this book was created Using Open Office 2.0.2,

About the Book
FBeginner is a concise, hands-on beginner’s guide to FreeBasic and is aimed at the 
novice programmer. The book assumes no prior programming knowledge. The goal of the 
book is to create a solid foundation in the basics of programming in FreeBasic that the 
programmer can build and expand upon. 
FreeBasic is a cross-platform compiler, however this book concentrates on using 
FreeBasic under the 32-bit Microsoft Windows™ and GNU/Linux operating systems. 
However, other than the installation and setup portions of this book, most of the code 
should run under any of the supported platforms.
All of the source code presented in this book is original code, and can be 
downloaded from the Clark Productions website located at http://rdc.ascii-world.com/ or 
http://freebasic.hmcsoft.org/.

Conventions Used in the Book
The various styles used in the book along with their meaning, are listed below. The 
basic paragraph format is the font you see here with each paragraph indented.

Information that is supplemental to the topic being discussed will be presented in 
the format below.

These colored boxes have additional, supplemental or historical information associated 
with the current topic being discussed.

Source code is listed in a fixed font with borders to delimit the code segment. You 
should always type in the programs. Most are small and can be entered into the editor in 
just a couple of minutes. The physical act of typing in the programs will help you learn 
the vocabulary and structure of FreeBasic. You do not type in the line numbers; they are 
only for referencing the code in the text. The file name for the program is located after 
the code segment.

1 Option&nbsp;Explicit
2 Cls
3 Print&nbsp;"Hello&nbsp;World&nbsp;From&nbsp;FreeBasic!"
4 Sleep
5 End
Listing 1: helloworld.bas

Following each listing is an analysis paragraph which explains how the program 
works. It is marked by the word Analysis: in bold with a fixed font. Even though many of 
the keywords you will see may have not be discussed in detail in the text, seeing these 
keywords in action will help you become familiar with the vocabulary of FreeBasic.

Analysis: This will mark the beginning of an analysis section. The code will be 
discussed using the line numbers referenced in the listing. You do not type the numbers 
in the editor.

The output of a program is listed in a fixed font and enclosed in a gray box as 
shown below. This output is given so you can compare the results to see if you have 
entered the program correctly.
Hello&nbsp;World&nbsp;from&nbsp;FreeBasic!
Output 1: program.bas

A potential problem is shown with a Caution paragraph. It is formatted similarly to 
the Analysis paragraph.
Caution This style will alert you to potential problems and offer some remedies or 
tips to avoid them.

1 A Brief Introduction to FreeBASIC
FreeBASIC is a 32-bit BASIC compiler that outputs native code for Microsoft 
Windows, Linux and DOS via DJGPP.  FreeBASIC is also Open Source, which means any 
one may freely view and edit the source to suit their needs.  Quickbasic Compatibility is 
FreeBASIC's call to fame, for it is the most compatible compiler available.

Differences from QuickBASIC
? Default (DEF###) type of not explicitly declared variables
? FreeBASIC: INTEGER
? QuickBASIC: Single
? INTEGER's size
? FreeBASIC: 32-bit, use SHORT type for 16-bit integers
? QuickBASIC: 16-bit
? Function calling
? FreeBASIC: All functions must have been declared, even with CALL.
? QuickBASIC: With CALL it is possible to invoke prototype-less functions.
? Arrays not declared
? FreeBASIC: All functions must be explicitly declared.
? QuickBASIC: Arrays are automagically created with up to 10 indexes.
? Variables with the same names as keywords
? FreeBASIC: Not allowed, even with suffixes.
? QuickBASIC: Allowed if no suffix is used (ie, dim LEFT as integer).
? Alignment / Padding of TYPE fields
? FreeBASIC: Same as in C, use FIELD=constant to change.
? QuickBASIC: Never done.
? Fixed-Length strings
? FreeBASIC: Real length is the given len plus one (null char), even on TYPE 
fields. Strings are filled with nulls, so strings can't contain null characters.
? QuickBASIC: Strings are filled with whitespaces.

14


Key Features of FreeBASIC
? Built-in Graphics library
? Completely compatible with old QB Graphics commands, but it builds on this 
to offer much more.
? Support for high resolutions and any color depth, and any number of 
offscreen pages.
? All drawing functions can operate on screen as well as on offscreen surfaces 
(GET/PUT buffers) of any size.
? Advanced sprites handling, with clipping, transparency, alpha and custom 
blending.
? Direct access to screen memory.
? BMP loading/saving capabilities.
? OpenGL support: init an OpenGL mode with a single command, then use GL 
instructions directly.
? Keyboard, mouse and joystick handling functions.
? The Graphics library is fast: MMX optimized routines are used if MMX is 
available.
? Small footprint: when using Graphics commands, your EXEs will grow in size 
by a minimum of 30/40K only.
? Stand-aloness: generated EXEs will depend only upon system libs, no 
external libraries required.
? As all of FB, also gfxlib is completely multiplatform: underneath it uses 
DirectX or GDI (if DX is not available) under Win32, direct VGA/ModeX/VESA 
access under DOS, or raw Xlib under Linux.
? Create OBJ's, LIB's, DLL's, and console or GUI EXE's
? You are in no way locked to an IDE or editor of any kind.
? You can create static and dynamic libraries adding just one command-line 
option (-lib or -dll).
? Debugging support
? Full debugging support with GDB (the GNU debugger) or Insight (the GDB 
GUI frontend)
? Array bounds checking (only enabled by the -exx command-line option)
? Null pointers checking (same as above)
? Function overloading
? DECLARE SUB Test OVERLOAD (a AS DOUBLE)
? DECLARE SUB Test (a AS SINGLE)
? DECLARE SUB Test (a AS INTEGER, b AS INTEGER = 1234)
? DECLARE SUB Test (a AS BYTE, b AS SHORT)

     15


? Inline Assembly
? Intel syntax.
? Reference variables directly by name with no "trick code" needed.
? Most of the known C libraries can be used directly, without wrappers
? GTK+ 2.0: cross-platform GUI Toolkit (over 1MB of headers, including 
support for Glade, libart and glGtk)
? libxml and libxslt: defacto standard XML and XSL libraries
? GSL - GNU Scientific library: complex numbers, vectors and matrices, FFT 
linear algebra, statistics, sorting, differential equations, and a dozen other 
sub-libraries with mathematical routines
? GMP - GNU Multiple Precision Arithmetic Library: known as the fastest 
bignum library
? SDL - Simple DirectMedia Layer: multimedia library for audio, user input, 3D 
and 2D gfx (including the sub-libraries such as SDL_Net, SDL_TTF, etc)
? OpenGL: portable library for developing interactive 2D and 3D graphics 
games and applications (including support for frameworks such as GLUT and 
GLFW)
? Allegro: game programming library (graphics, sounds, player input, etc)
? GD, DevIL, FreeImage, GRX and other graphic-related libraries
? OpenAL, Fmod, BASS: 2D and 3D sound systems, including support for mod, 
mp3, ogg, etc
? ODE and Newton - dynamics engines: libraries for simulating rigid body 
dynamics
? cgi-util and FastCGI: web development
? DirectX and the Windows API - the most complete headers set between the 
BASIC compilers available, including support for the Unicode functions
? DispHelper - COM IDispatch interfaces made easy
? And many more!
? Support for numeric (integer or floating-point) and strings types
? DECLARE SUB Test(a AS DOUBLE = 12.345, BYVAL b AS BYTE = 255, BYVAL s 
AS STRING = "abc")
? Unicode support
? Besides ASCII files with Unicode escape sequences (\u), FreeBASIC can parse 
UTF-8, UTF-16LE, UTF-16BE, UTF-32LE and UTF-32BE source (.bas) or header 
(.bi) files, they can freely mixed with other sources/headers in the same 
project (also with other ASCII files).
? Literal strings can be typed in the original non-latin alphabet, just use an 
text-editor that supports some of the Unicode formats listed above.
? The WSTRING type holds wide-characters, all string functions (like LEFT, 
TRIM, etc) will work with wide-strings too.

16


? Unlimited number of symbols
? Being a 32-bit application, FreeBASIC can compile source code files up to 2 
GB long.
? The number of symbols (variables, constants, et cetera) is only limited by 
the total memory available during compile time. You can, for example, 
include OpenGL, SDL, BASS, and GTK simultaneously in your source code.

     17


2 Numeric Data Types
When starting out with a new programming language, one of the first things you 
should learn is the language’s data types. Virtually every program manipulates data, and 
to correctly manipulate that data you must thoroughly understand the available data 
types. Data type errors rank second to syntax errors but they are a lot more troublesome. 
The compiler can catch syntax errors and some data type errors, but most data type 
errors occur when the program is running, and often only when using certain types of 
data. These kind of intermittent errors are difficult to find and difficult to fix. Knowing the 
kind, size and limits of the data types will help keep these kinds of errors to a minimum.
FreeBasic has all the standard numeric data types that you would expect for a 
Basic compiler, as well as pointers which you usually only find in lower-level languages 
such as C. Table 3.1 lists all the numeric data types that FreeBasic supports. In the list 
below, you will notice that Integer and Long are grouped together. This is because a Long 
is just an alias for Integer. They are exactly the same data type.

Numeric Data Types Size Limits
Byte 8-bit signed, 1 byte -128 to 127
Double 64-bit, floating point, 8 
bytes

-2.2E-308 to +1.7E+308

Integer (Long) 32-bit, signed, 4 bytes -2,147,483,648 to 
2,147,483,647
LongInt 64-bit, signed, 8 bytes -9,223,372,036,854 775 808 
to 9,223 
372,036,854,775,807
Short 16-bit, signed, 2 bytes -32,768 to 32,767
Single 32-bit, floating point, 4 
bytes

1.1 E-38 to 3.43 E+38

UByte 8-bit, unsigned, 1 byte 0 to 255
UInteger 32-bit, unsigned , 4 bytes 0 to 4,294,967,295
ULongInt 64-bit, unsigned, 8 bytes 0 to 
18,446,744,073,709,551,61
5
Ushort 16-bit, unsigned, 2 bytes 0 to 65365
Pointer 32-bit, memory address, 4 
bytes

Must be initialized at 
runtime

Table 2.1: FreeBasic Numeric Data Types
Signed Versus Unsigned Data Types
Signed data types, as the name implies, can be negative, zero or positive. 
Unsigned types can only be zero or positive, which give them a greater positive range 

18


than their signed counterparts. If your data will never be negative, using the unsigned 
data types will allow you to store larger numbers in the same size variable.
The Floating Point Data Type
The floating point data types, Single and Double are able to store numbers with 
decimal digits. Keep in mind that floating-point numbers are subject to rounding errors, 
which can accumulate over long calculations. You should carry more than the number of 
decimal digits than you need to ensure the greatest accuracy.
Pointer Data Types
Pointer data types are unlike the other data types in that they store a memory 
address and not data. Since pointers are handled differently than regular data types, a 
separate chapter has been devoted to the subject and will not be examined in this 
chapter.
Numeric Variables
The numeric data types define what numbers you can work with in your program, 
but you must create variables to actually hold the numbers. A variable is a name 
composed of letters, numbers or the underscore character such as MyInteger, or 
MyInteger2. There are rules for variable naming though, that you must keep in mind. 
• Variable names must start with a letter or the underscore character. It is not 
recommended however, to use the underscore character, as this is generally used 
to indicate a system variable, and it is best to avoid it in case there may be 
conflicts with existing system variable names.
• Most punctuation marks have a special meaning in FreeBasic and cannot be used 
in a variable name. While the period can be used, it is also used as a deference 
operator in Types, and so should not be used to avoid confusion or potential 
problems with future versions of the compiler.
• Numbers can be used in a variable name, but cannot be the first character. MyVar1 
is legal, but 1MyVar will generate a compiler error.
The compiler creates variables in two ways. The first method, which isn’t 
recommended and has been moved to the QB compatibility mode, is to let the compiler 
create variables on their first use. When the compiler first encounters a name in a 
program that is not a reserved word or keyword, it creates a variable using that name 
with the default data type. In most cases, the default data type is an integer. You can 
change the default variable type by using the DEF### directive, which will be covered 
later in this chapter. To enable these features, you must compile your program with either 
“-lang qb” or “-lang deprecated”. The problem with the first-use method is that it is very 
easy to introduce hard-to-find bugs in your program.

     19


The term “bug” for a software error has a long, and somewhat disputed history. The 
term predates modern computers and was used to describe industrial or electrical 
defects. Its use in relation to software errors is credited to Grace Hopper, a pioneer in 
the field of software design. According to the story, a moth was discovered between two 
electrical relays in a Mark II computer. Hopper made a note of it in her journal, along 
with the moth, and the term became associated with software errors after the incident. 
The moth is now on display at the Smithsonian.1

The Dim Statement
The second, and preferred method is to explicitly declare variables in your program 
using the Dim statement. The Dim statement instructs the compiler to set aside some 
memory for a variable of a particular data type.  For example, the statement Dim 
myInteger as Integer instructs the compiler to set aside 4 byes of storage for the 
variable myInteger. Whenever you manipulate myInteger in a program, the compiler will 
manipulate the data at the memory location set aside for myInteger. Just as with variable 
names, there are some rules for the use of Dim as well.
1. Dim myVar As Integer. This will create a single integer-type variable.
2. Dim As Integer myVar, myVar2. This will create two integer-type 
variables.
3. Dim myVar As Double, myVar2 As Integer. This will create a double-
type variable and an integer-type variable.
4. Dim myVar as Integer = 5. This will create an integer-type variable 
and set the value of the variable to 5.
5. Dim myVar As Double = 5.5, myVar2 As Integer = 5. This will 
create a double-type variable and set the value to 5.5, and an integer-
type variable and set the value to 5.
6. Dim Shared as Integer myInt. This will create a shared (global) 
variable myInt accessible anywhere within your program.

Caution Dim myVar, myVar2 As Double. This may look like it creates two 
double-type variables, however myVar will not be defined and will result in compilation 
errors. Use rule 2 if you want to create multiple variables of the same type.

Shared Variables
As you can see in rule 6 above, using the Dim Shared version of Dim creates a 
shared variable. This means that any variable you create as Shared can be accessed 
anywhere within the program’s current module. To put it another way, the scope of a 
shared variable is module level scope. Scope refers to the visibility of a variable, where 
you can access a particular variable within a program. There are different levels of scope 
and each are discussed in detail later in this book.

The number of variables in your program (as well as the program itself) is limited only 
by your available memory, up to 2 gigabytes.

Static Variables
Static variables are used within subroutines and functions and retain their values 
between calls to the subroutine or functions. The following program demonstrates using a 
static variable as a counter within a subroutine.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;StaticSub
Next

Sleep
End

Listing 2.1: static.bas

Analysis: In line 1 the subroutine StaticSub is defined. A subroutine is code that is 
executed only when called by the subroutine name which, in this case, is StaticSub. Line 
3 dimensions a static variable cnt, which is incremented when the subroutine is called in 
line 6. Line 7 prints out the current value of cnt to the console screen.
In line 10 a working varible that will be used in the For-Next is declared. Lines 14 
through 16 define the For-Next loop which will call StaticSub 10 times. Line 18 waits for a 
key press and line 19 ends the program.

Running the program in FBIde, you should get the following output.

In&nbsp;StaticSub&nbsp;1&nbsp;time(s).
In&nbsp;StaticSub&nbsp;2&nbsp;time(s).
In&nbsp;StaticSub&nbsp;3&nbsp;time(s).
In&nbsp;StaticSub&nbsp;4&nbsp;time(s).

In&nbsp;StaticSub&nbsp;5&nbsp;time(s).
In&nbsp;StaticSub&nbsp;6&nbsp;time(s).
In&nbsp;StaticSub&nbsp;7&nbsp;time(s).
In&nbsp;StaticSub&nbsp;8&nbsp;time(s).
In&nbsp;StaticSub&nbsp;9&nbsp;time(s).
In&nbsp;StaticSub&nbsp;10&nbsp;time(s).
Output 2.1: Output of static.bas

As you can see from the output, the value of cnt is preserved between calls to the 
subroutine. Static variables can only be defined within a subroutine or function. Variables 
declared outside of a subroutine or function, that is at the module level, will maintain 
their values and are static by default.
Common Variables
Variables declared as Common can be shared between multiple code modules, that 
is between multiple bas files in the same program. Common variables will be discussed in 
detail later in this book.
Extern and Import Variables
Extern and Import are used when creating DLL's and like Common, are designed to 
share variables in different modules.  Extern and Import will be discussed in detail in the 
chapter on creating DLLs with FreeBasic.
Data Type Suffixes
You can use QuickBasic style data type suffixes in FreeBasic, although this feature 
was implemented mainly to support QuickBasic legacy code and is only available when 
compiling with the “-lang qb” or “-lang deprecated” compiler options. Table 3.2 lists the 
data type suffixes.

Changing The Default Data Type
As already mentioned, the default data type for an undeclared variable is an 
integer. The default data type can be changed for a range of variables by using one of 
the DEF statements. Table 3.3 lists all the DEF statements available in FreeBasic.

Statement Comment
DEFBYTE a-b Sets the default data type to byte for 
undeclared variables starting with letter 
range.
DEFDBL a-b Sets the default data type to double for 
undeclared variables starting with letter 
range.
DEFINT a-b Sets the default data type to integer for 
undeclared variables starting with letter 
range.
DEFLNG a-b Sets the default data type to long for 
undeclared variables starting with letter 
range.
DEFLNGINT a-b Sets the default data type to longint for 
undeclared variables starting with letter 
range.
DEFSHORT a-b Sets the default data type to short for 
undeclared variables starting with letter 
range.
DEFSNG a-b Sets the default data type to single for 
undeclared variables starting with letter 
range.
DEFSTR a-b Sets the default data type to string for 
undeclared variables starting with letter 
range.
DEFUBYTE a-b Sets the default data type to ubyte for 
undeclared variables starting with letter 
range.
DEFUINT a-b Sets the default data type to uinteger 
for undeclared variables starting with 
letter range.
DEFULNGINT a-b Sets the default data type to ulongint for 
undeclared variables starting with letter 
range.
DEFUSHORT a-b Sets the default data type to ushort for 
undeclared variables starting with letter 
range.
Table 2.3: FreeBasic DEF Statements

     23


The DEF statement will affect all variables that start with a letter in the given 
range. So if you add DEFDBL m-n to your program, any variable starting with m or n, will 
default to a double-type. All other variables that start with different numbers will default 
to an integer-type. A Dim statement will override any DEF statement, so if you declare an 
integer variable starting with m, it will be an integer, even though the DEFDBL is in 
effect.
Using Different Number Formats
Besides decimal numbers, FreeBasic is able to recognize numbers in hexadecimal, 
binary and octal formats. Table 3.4 lists the number base and format to use.
Number Base Format
Decimal myVar = 254
Hexadecimal myVar = &amp;HFE
Binary myVar = &amp;B11111110
Octal myVar = &amp;O376
Exponential Numbers myVar = 243E10
Table 2.4: Format of Number Bases

Hexadecimal Numbers
Hexadecimal is a base 16 numbering scheme and have digits in the range of 0 to F. 
Hexadecimal numbers are commonly used as constant values in the Windows API and 
many third party libraries as it is a compact way to represent a large value. To indicate a 
hexadecimal number, use the &amp;H prefix.
Binary Numbers
Binary is a base 2 numbering scheme and have digits in the range of 0 and 1. 
Binary is the language of the computer. Although we can enter numbers and letters into 
the computer, it all must be translated into binary before the computer can understand 
it. To indicate a binary number, use the &amp;B prefix.
Octal Numbers
Octal is a base eight numbering scheme and have digits in the range of 0 to 7. 
Octal numbers were very popular in early computer systems, but aren’t used much today 
except in some specialized applications. To indicate an octal number, use the &amp;O prefix.
Exponential Numbers
You can use exponential numbers in your program by adding the E suffix followed 
by the power. To use the number 105, you would write the number as 10E05. You can 
directly set a double or single type variable using the exponent format. You can also use 
negative exponents such as 10E-5, which when printed to the screen would like 1.e­004.

24


Which Data Type To Use?
There are a number of different data types available, so how do you choose the 
right data type for any given application? The rule of thumb is to use the largest data 
type you need to hold the expected range of values. This may seem like stating the 
obvious, but many programs fail because the programmer did not fully understand the 
range of data in their program. When you crate a program, you should map out not only 
the logic of the program, but the data associated with each block of logic. When you map 
out the data ahead of time, you are less likely to run into data-type errors.
For example, if you were working with ASCII codes, which range from 0 to 255, an 
ubyte would be a good choice since the range of an ubyte is the same as the range of 
ASCII codes, and you are only using 1 byte of memory. There is another consideration 
though, the “natural” data size of the computer. On a 32-bit system, the natural data size 
is 4 bytes, or an integer. This means that the computer is optimized to handle an integer, 
and does so more efficiently, even though you are “wasting” 3 bytes of memory by using 
an integer for an ASCII code.
In most cases an integer is a good general-purpose choice for integer data. The 
range is quite large, it handles both negative and positive numbers and you benefit from 
using the computer’s natural data type. For floating point data, a double is a good choice 
since, like the integer, it has a good range of values and better precision than a single. 
For large integer data you should use a uinteger for positive data or a longint for large 
negative and positive numbers. These are only suggestions; what data type you end up 
using will be dictated by the needs of your program.

These “rules of thumb” apply to single variable declarations where a few wasted bytes 
are not critical. However, as you will see in the chapter on arrays, choosing the right 
sized data type is critical in large arrays where a few wasted bytes can add up to a 
large amount of wasted memory.

Option Explicit
You may notice when looking at other people's source code, the compiler directive 
Option Explicit has been used at the top of each program. A compiler directive is code 
that instructs the compiler to do something. In the case of Option Explicit, it instructs the 
compiler to make sure that any variable being used has been properly Dim’ed. Although 
you can write a program without using Option Explicit and explicitly Dim’ing each 
variable, you run the risk of introducing nasty, hard-to-find bugs as the following short 
program illustrates.

Dim&nbsp;myInteger&nbsp;as&nbsp;Integer
'set&nbsp;myInteger&nbsp;to&nbsp;a&nbsp;value

'Oops&nbsp;we&nbsp;mispelled&nbsp;the&nbsp;variable&nbsp;name
Print&nbsp;"The&nbsp;output&nbsp;of&nbsp;myInteger&nbsp;is";myIntger
'wait&nbsp;for&nbsp;a&nbsp;keypress
Sleep
End
Listing 2.2: nooptionexplicit.bas

     25


Analysis: In line 1 myInteger is being declared to the compiler. The compiler will 
use this declaration to allocate space for the variable. In line 3 the variable is being 
initialized to a value, in this case 3. The Print statement in line 5 will print out the result 
to the console screen. Sleep, listed in line 7, will wait for a keypress and the End keyword 
in line 8 will end the program. The End statement isn't mandatory at the end of a 
program but should be used especially if you want to return an exit code to the operating 
system.

After typing this program into FBIde and running the program, you should see the 
following output.

The&nbsp;output&nbsp;of&nbsp;myInteger&nbsp;is&nbsp;0
Output 2.2: nooptionexplicit.bas

The output should be 5, but as you can see, the result isn’t what was expected or 
wanted. Since Option Explicit wasn’t used in the program, the compiler created a new 
variable when it encountered the misspelled variable name, myIntger, in the print 
statement. If this was large and complicated program, you can see how difficult it would 
be to track this error down and fix it.
Now, add Option Explicit at the top of the program and run it again. You should see 
the following error message in the results pane of FBIde.

Variable&nbsp;not&nbsp;declared,&nbsp;found:&nbsp;'myIntger'
Print&nbsp;"The&nbsp;output&nbsp;of&nbsp;myInteger&nbsp;is";myIntger
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;^
Output 2.3: Modified nooptionexplicit.bas

Here the compiler detected the misspelled variable name and informed us of the 
problem. You should always use Option Explicit in your programs. A few seconds of extra 
typing will save you hours of frustration.
A Note about Option Explicit 
Recent versions of the FreeBASIC compiler do not allow OPTION commands 
including OPTION EXPLICIT. From now on OPTION EXPLICIT is implied and your programs 
will behave as if you used OPTION EXPLICIT. It is a good rule of thumb to always implicitly 
declare your variables, so get in the habit now. To compile a source file that uses OPTION 
EXPLICIT, either use “-lang deprecated” or remove the OPTION EXPLICIT line from the 
source file.
A Look Ahead
When working with numeric data, there are times when it becomes necessary to 
convert one data type to another. FreeBasic offers two conversion methods, implicit and 
explicit, which you will see in the next chapter.

     27


3 Converting Numeric Data Types
When you work with numbers there will come a time when you will need to convert 
a variable from one data type to another data type. In FreeBasic there are two types of 
data conversion. Implicit, where the compiler will automatically convert the data types 
during an assignment or calculation, and explicit using one of the predefined conversion 
functions.
Implicit Data Conversion
Implicit data conversion occurs either through an assignment statement, or as the 
result of a calculation. Where implicit data conversion can cause a problem is in the loss 
of precision that can result when converting a large data type to a smaller data type. 
While implicit data conversion eases the programming process somewhat, you want to 
make sure that the results you are getting are what you expect. You should always check 
the result of an implicit conversion to make sure the range of values being converted is in 
the expected range.
The following short program illustrates the conversion that takes place during an 
assignment statement.

Dim&nbsp;As&nbsp;Double&nbsp;myDbl
Dim&nbsp;As&nbsp;Integer&nbsp;myInt

myDbl&nbsp;=&nbsp;5.56
'Assign&nbsp;myInt&nbsp;the&nbsp;float,&nbsp;will&nbsp;be&nbsp;converted&nbsp;to&nbsp;int
myInt&nbsp;=&nbsp;myDbl
Print&nbsp;"myInt&nbsp;=";&nbsp;myInt
Sleep
End

Listing 3.1: assignconv.bas

Analysis:&nbsp;In lines 1 and 2 two variable are being declared, myDbl, a double-type 
varibale and myInt, an integer-type variable. Line 3 is a comment which, as you can see, 
starts with the ' (single quote) character. In line 4 the double-type variable is being 
initialized to the floating-point value 5.56. In line 6 the double is being assigned to an 
integer variable, invoking the implicit conversion. In line 7 the Print displays the result on 
the console window. In line 8 the program waits for a key press with the Sleep statement 
and in line 9 the End statement is used to end the program.

Running the program will result in the following output.

myInt&nbsp;=&nbsp;6
Output 3.1: assignconv.bas
28


In the program, the value of myDbl which is a double-type variable, was set to 
5.56. When myInt was assigned this float value, the compiler converted the value to an 
integer, and then rounded it up to 6. Maybe you were just looking for the whole number 
portion of 5? In this case, your result would be incorrect, although you may not know until 
later in the program. This type of subtle bug is another one of those problems that are 
hard to track down and fix.

Caution Even if the compiler is producing the correct result, there is no guarantee 
that future versions of the compiler will. It may be necessary to change the behavior of 
the compiler to add features or fix a bug, and you may find yourself with a program that 
suddenly quits working. 
The next little program illustrates the implicit conversion that takes place during a 
calculation. In this example, the two integer operands are converted to double-types 
during the division calculation.

myInt1&nbsp;=&nbsp;5
myInt2&nbsp;=&nbsp;3
myDbl&nbsp;=&nbsp;myInt1&nbsp;/&nbsp;myInt2
Print&nbsp;"myDbl&nbsp;=";&nbsp;myDbl
Sleep
End

Listing 3.2: calcconv.bas

Analysis: Line 1 and 2 in the program are the alternate Dim statement formats. You 
can use this format to declare multiple variables of the same type. In line 4 and 5, the 
variables are initialized. In line 6 the / character is the division operator. The result of the 
division operation will be implicitly converted to a double-type in the assignment 
statement. Line 7 prints the newly converted value to the screen and in lines 8 and 9, the 
program will wait for a key press and then end.

Running the program produces the following output.
myDbl&nbsp;=&nbsp;1.66666666666667
Output 3.2: calconv.bas

The result is as expected since the double-type has a greater precision than the 
integer-type. However, consider this program and its output, which demonstrates the 
implicit rounding during calculations.

myDbl2&nbsp;=&nbsp;3.1
myInt&nbsp;=&nbsp;myDbl1&nbsp;/&nbsp;myDbl2
Print&nbsp;"myInt&nbsp;=";&nbsp;myInt
Sleep
End

Listing 3.3: calcconv2.bas

Analysis: This program is similar to the program in Listing 4.2 except the 
conversion process is from two double-type variables to an integer. Lines 1 and 2 declare 
the working variables. Lines 4 and 5 set the values of the two double-type variables. In 
line 6 the double-type division result is implicitly converted to an integer, resulting in 
precision loss. Line 7 prints the result to the console window and lines 8 and 9 wait for a 
key press and end the program.

The output of the program:

myInt&nbsp;=&nbsp;2
Output 3.3: calconv2.bas

In this example, the two double-type variables were converted to integers and 
then the division operation was performed. Since 5.6 was rounded up to 6 during the 
conversion, the result is 2 rather than 1. This may not be a problem, but you should be 
aware that these types of conversions occur when working with mixed precision types.
Explicit Data Conversion
There is an alternative to implicit data conversion, explicit data conversion where 
you use one of FreeBasic’s built-in conversion functions. Since these functions are 
designed for conversion, they return consistent results and are unlikely to change even if 
the implicit rules of the compiler change. Even though it is more work, it is always safer 
to explicitly convert data to the needed data type before carrying out operations on that 
data.
Numeric Data Conversion Functions
Table 4.1 lists all the conversion functions. Keep in mind that these functions do 
not check for overflow, so be sure that the value passed to these functions is in the 
expected range.

When examining conversion functions it is important to understand how the 
function rounds with both negative and positive numbers. The FreeBasic conversion 
functions round numbers up, making positive number more positive and negative 
numbers more negative. The following program illustrates the rounding with Cast and 
Cint, as well as demonstrating that the conversion functions will work with expressions as 
well as numbers.

Listing 3.4: convert.bas

Analysis: This program demonstrates the built-in FreeBasic conversion functions. 
Lines 1 and 2 declare the working variables using the alternate format of the Dim. Two 
tables of information are printed to the console in line 12 to 18 and lines 21 to 27. In lines 
13 to 16, the result of the Cast function is printed directly to the screen, as is the Cint 
function in lines 22 to 26. Normally the values would be saved in another variable to be 
used in the program. Line 16 ends with a semi-colon. This instructs the compiler not to 
32


print a carriage return after the print statement, so that when the value of Cast is printed 
in line 17, the value will appear on the same line as the data printed in line 16. The 
program is closed in the usual way using Sleep and End.

Running the program will produce the output shown below.

**&nbsp;Cast&nbsp;**

Output 3.4: convert.bas

As you can see from the program, you can use both numbers and expressions in 
the conversion functions. Keep in mind that if you pass an expression to a conversion 
function, the evaluated expression must not exceed the limit of the target data type, or 
an overflow will occur. Looking at the output you can see that the rounding for middle 
values is up or greater in magnitude. 143.5 rounds up, making the resulting number more 
positive and –143.5, more negative.
Using Conversion Functions in Macros
One area where the conversion functions listed in Table 4.1 are useful is in the 
creation of macros. A macro is a small piece of executable code that the compiler inserts 
into the program at designated areas. Macros are defined using the #Define compiler 
directive. #Define has the format #Define&nbsp;name&nbsp;symbol. When the compiler encounters 
name within the program code, it is replaced with symbol.
The following program creates a macro that packs a screen row and column 
number into the high and low bytes of a uinteger. The conversion function Cint is used 
since you will not always know the data type being passed to the macro, and you want to 
be sure that you are working with known quantities.

Listing 3.5: makdword.bas

Analysis: In line 2 the #define compiler directive is used to create a macro. A 
macro is an snippet of executable code that the compiler will insert into the code when it 
finds the macro name,  MAKDWORD. In lines 4 and 5 the working variables are declared. 
In line 8, the variable myInt is initialized with the macro previously defined. The macro 
stores the screen locations, row 5 and column 5 in the high and low word of the integer 
variable.
In line 11 the Width statement is used to set the console screen to 80 columns and 
25 rows. The variable cnt, which will be used to print out the column and row headers, is 
set to 1. Lines 14 through 24 prints out the column headers using a For-Next loop. Line 19 
uses the Locate statement to set the cursor position and line 36 prints out the value. The 
numbers will range from 1 to 0 and then repeat.
In line 36 the Str function is used to convert the numeric value of cnt to a string so 
that the Print statement will not insert a leading space. Print inserts a leading space when 
printing numeric variables so they can accommodate a leading negative sign. Lines 26 
through 39 print out the row headers in the same fashion as the column headers. 
In line 42 the two functions Hiword and Loword are used to retrieve the high and 
low bytes of the integer variable, which contain the row and column respectively. Line 45 
and 46 wait for a key press and end the program in the usual fashion.

The macro is defined in line 2 takes two parameters, x and y. The compiler will 
substitute MAKDWORD(x,y) with  (cint(x)&nbsp;shl&nbsp;16&nbsp;or&nbsp;cint(y)) replacing x with the first 
number and y with the second number. Cint is used within the macro so that no matter 
what values are passed through x and y, the macro will always be working with integers. 
The operators or and shl will be discussed later in the book.
The Locate statement expects a row number and column number to position text 
on the screen. In line 42 we are using the two functions Hiword and Loword to return the 
high (most significant) and low (least significant) words of the integer myInt, which 
contain the row and column numbers respectively. 
Running the program will produce the following output.

12345678901234567890123456789012345678901234567890123456789012345678901234567890

Decimal Rounding Functions
FreeBasic has two built-in rounding functions for use with decimal numbers. Table 
4.2 lists the functions along with their explanations.

Function Syntax Comment
Int B = Int(expression) Returns an integer value less than or equal to 
the input.
Fix B = Fix(expression) Returns the integer part of the input.
Table 3.2: FreeBasic Rounding Functions

As with the other conversion functions, this should be tested with both negative 
and positive numbers to see how the function behaves. The program intfix.bas listed 
below illustrates the results returned by the functions as well as their use with 
calculations.

Listing 3.6: intfix.bas

Analysis: Line 2 uses the alternative syntax for Dim to declare and initialize the 
working variables. Line 4 through 6 display the results of the conversion function suing 
both positive and negative numbers. Line 9 and 10 set the values for the variables to be 
used in calculations. Lines 12 through 14 display the results of the conversion functions 
using calculations so FreeBasic resolves the calculations before invoking the functions. 
Lines 17 and 18 end the program in the usual way.

The result of running the program is shown in Output 4.6.

Doubles:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;­5.5&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;5.9
Int:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;­6&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;5

Fix:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;6
Output 3.6: infix.bas

Notice that in the output Int returns a –6 for the input –5.5, since 6 is less than –
5.5, and 5 for 5.9 since 5 is less than 6. Fix on the other hand truncates the decimal and 
returns the integer portion of the double. As you can see both functions will also work 
with an expression, in this myDouble1 + myDouble2. Which function you would use 
depends on what behavior you would need with negative numbers, as they both return 
similar results with positive numbers.
A Look Ahead
In addition to the built-in conversion functions, there are a number of functions 
available in the C Runtime Library, which is the subject of the next chapter.

4 Introduction to the C Runtime Library
One of the original motivations for creating FreeBasic was to provide an easy-to-
use wrapper for the C Runtime Library according to Andre Victor, the language creator. 
FreeBasic is as advanced as it is today because many of the functions are wrappers for 
the runtime functions, which simplified the creation of the language. 
Since FreeBasic uses the C runtime library, you can use it as well in your programs, 
and there are a number of very useful conversion functions available. The function 
definitions are contained in the header file crt.bi, and you gain access to those functions 
by using the #Include directive.

Caution Not all the functions  listed in the various bi files in the crt folder 
have been implemented in FreeBasic. If you get an error similar to the following 
[path/filename].o:fake:(.text+0x16c): undefined reference to `rint', where path/filename is your 
program's path and filename, then the function you are trying to use is not supported. 
This is a linker error and indicates that the linker was not able to find the referenced 
function. There are also a number of functions and structures that will only work in 
Windows and some that are GNU Extensions and will only work on Linux.

The #Include Directive
The syntax for the #Include directive is #Include [Once] “filename.ext”. 
Remember that a compiler directive instructs the compiler to do something, and in his 
case, it instructs the compiler to include the file “filename.ext” when compiling. When the 
compiler reads this directive, it stops reading the current file and starts reading the 
included file. If the included file also has an #Include directive, then that file is read in as 
well. You can have up to 16 nested includes per program. To use the runtime conversion 
functions in your own program you would add #Include Once “crt.bi” at the top of 
your program.
The file extension bi stands for “basic include” and is usually declaration 
statements and/or subroutines and functions. The crt.bi file is located in the inc folder of 
your FreeBasic installation. If a bi file is not located in the folder where the program is 
being compiled, the compiler will look in the inc folder for the file. If it can’t find the file, it 
will issue an error. You can also include a path with the filename if you keep your include 
files in a common folder besides the inc folder.
If you look at the contents of crt.bi you see that the file simply includes other files 
and references the library that contains the actual function code.

#include&nbsp;once&nbsp;"crt/io.bi"
#include&nbsp;once&nbsp;"crt/errno.bi"

#endif&nbsp;'&nbsp;__CRT_BI__
Listing 4.1: crt.bi

Analysis: Crt.bi contains a number of compiler directives, the statements that start 
with the # character to control the compilation process. In line the directive #ifndef 
means “if not defined”. If the symbol __CRT_BI__ has not already been defined, then line 
2 will define the symbol. The #ifdef directive in line 4 means “if defined”. If the compiler 
is running on a Win32 machine, the symbol __FB_WIN32__ will be defined which will 
include the library "msvcrt" on line 5 with the #inclib directive which means “include 
library”. The #endif on line 6 closes the opening #ifdef on line 4. Under Windows, 
FreeBasic uses the Microsoft Runtime which is contained in the dynamic link library (DLL) 
msvcrt.dll.
Line 8 through 15 include each of the individual declaration files that make up the 
C runtime library. The “#include once” directive ensures that the individual include files 
are only added once, even if another module includes them. The #endif on line 17 is 
used to close the #ifndef on line 1.

Notice that the #Include directive use the Once modifier which tells the compiler 
that this file should only be loaded once, even if a subsequent file uses the same 
#Include. This is to prevent duplicate definition errors. It is always good practice to use 
the Once modifier in your own includes. 
Notice that the different files being included are located in the inc/crt folder. This is 
an example of setting the path for the #Include if they should be in a different folder. 
Many of the third-party library bi files are in their own subfolders, just to keep things a bit 
more organized. The conversion functions we will be examining in this chapter are 
contained the file crt/math.bi.

The #Inclib directive above the include list tells the compiler what library contains the 
functions. Library files are compiled subroutines, functions and symbols that define the 
functionality of the library. Lib files located in the lib folder of your FreeBasic installation. 
They are usually named filename.a for static libraries and filename.dll.a for dynamic 
link libraries. If you look in the lib folder you will also see some filename.o files. These 
are object files. Object files contain pre-parsed code that can be linked to an executable 
file or to a library file.

Caution If you open one of the bi files in the inc folder, which you may need to do 
from time to time to see what parameters a function requires or to see the return type of 
40


a function, be sure not to change anything in the file. You should always open the files in 
read-only mode if your editor provides that functionality.

The Declaration Statement
If you look at math.bi you will see a number of Declaration statements. A 
declaration statement is a function prototype that tells the compiler that there is a 
function definition somewhere in the program code, or in a library or an external dll. This 
forward reference is used so that the compiler won’t complain if the function or sub is 
called before it finds the actual code for the function.  Once you understand how to 
interpret a declaration statement, you will be able to use any function in the runtime 
library.
To understand the components of a declaration statement, here is the declaration 
statement for the ceil function in math.bi. The ceil function rounds a decimal value up to 
the nearest integer. That is, 1.5 would become 2.

Declare&nbsp;function&nbsp;ceil&nbsp;cdecl&nbsp;Alias&nbsp;"ceil"&nbsp;(byval&nbsp;as&nbsp;double)&nbsp;as&nbsp;double

You can break this declare down into the following functional sections.
• Declare: This is the keyword for a declare statement.
• Function: This can either be Function, to indicate that this procedure returns a 
value, or Sub, which indicates that the procedure does not return a value.
• Ceil: This is the name of the function and the name that you would use in your 
code. Do not use the name after Alias.
• Cdecl: This is the function's method of passing arguments. When calling an 
external function, parameters must be pushed on the stack in the correct order so 
that the function can pop the parameters off the stack correctly. Cdecl stands for C 
Declare, and passes the arguments from right to left using the C convention of 
parameter passing. The Pascal calling convention pushes arguments from left to 
right and is used when calling functions created in the Pascal language. The 
Stdcall calling convention pushes arguments from right to left and is used in Basic 
libraries and Windows API.
• Alias: This is an alternate name that is used by the linker when your code is linked 
to other languages. You use an alias in case there is a function in the target 
language that has the same name as your function.
• ( ): The values inside the parenthesis are the parameters that the function or sub 
expects. Ceil expects one parameter, a double-type value. If the function expects 
multiple parameters, then commas will separate them. A parameter can be any of 
the FreeBasic data types or a composite type. Many of the runtime functions 
require pointers to other data types or data structures. 
• ByVal: The byval (by value) keyword indicates that the value being passed to the 
function is a copy of the data, and not the actual data itself. This is to prevent 
accidentally changing the actual data within a function. You can also use ByRef 
(by reference) which passes the address of the data to the function, and any 
changes in the parameter are reflected in the actual data. ByVal is the default 
behavior in current versions of the compiler.

     41


• As [data type]: The As keyword after the parameter list indicates the return type 
of the function. Subs do not have a return type so there isn’t an As clause after the 
parameter list.
Notice that the ceil function returns a double and not an integer, even though the 
conversion function rounds off the decimal portion. This is to prevent integer overflow for 
very large numbers. Even though ceil, and the other runtime conversion functions return 
a double you can implicitly convert them to integers by simply assigning the return to an 
integer variable or using the Cast function. Be sure to use an integer data type with a 
large enough range for the result.
To use Ceil in your program you would write myDouble&nbsp;=&nbsp;Ceil(aDouble)&nbsp;or  myInt&nbsp;=&nbsp;
Ceil(aDouble). All declaration statements follow the same pattern as Ceil.

DLLs created with Visual Basic 6tm and below are COM objects and not standard 
DLLs. In order to use VB6 DLLs with FreeBasic you will need to create a COM interface to 
access the DLL functions. Creating a COM interface is a complicated topic and is beyond 
the scope of this book. 

Runtime Conversion Functions
Table 5.1 lists some of the more useful conversion routines contained within the 
runtime library along with he syntax and some comments about the function.

Function Syntax Comment
Ceil B = Ceil(double-type 
expression)

Ceil returns the nearest 
integer greater than 
expression.

Floor B = Floor(double-type 
expression)

Floor returns the nearest 
integer less than expression. 

Modf B = Modf(double-type 
expression, double-type 
pointer)

Modf returns the fractions 
part of expression and the 
integer part of expression in 
the double-type pointer. The 
integer part of expression is 
rounded towards zero.

Table 4.1: Runtime Conversion Functions

It would require another book to examine all the functions in the runtime library. The 
runtime functions presented in this book were selected because of their usefulness and 
to supplement FreeBasic’s built-in functions.

Modf deserves special mention. A function can only return a single value, the value 
defined in the As clause after the parameter list. This does not mean however that you 
cannot return more than one value from a function. Any additional values a function 
returns must be returned through the parameter list. One way to do this is to use the 
Byref keyword on parameters.  Any changes made to a byref parameter changes the 
actual data. However, you cannot use byref on external libraries, due to differences in 
42


calling procedures, so pointers are used instead. There are two ways to pass pointer data 
to a function; by explicitly declaring a pointer data type which you will see in the chapter 
on pointers, or by using the AddressOf operator which is explained here.
The AddressOf Operator @
When the compiler creates a variable, it allocates a portion of memory equal to the 
size of the data type. For an integer it would allocate 4 bytes and for a double it would 
allocate 8 bytes. Each memory location has an address associated with it so that the CPU 
can move data into and out of the memory location. When the compiler allocates the 
memory, the operating system returns an address for the memory location so that the 
compiler can access that location. When you are working with variables you are actually 
working with an addressable memory location in the computer. You don't have to worry 
about the address since the compiler handles all those details for you; you can just use 
the variable in your program.
However, when you need to call a function like Modf that requires a pointer to a 
variable, then you need to know the address of the variable so you can pass it to the 
function. Why can't you just use the variable name, since it is an alias for the memory 
location? The answer is in the declaration of Modf shown in listing 5.3.

1 declare&nbsp;function&nbsp;modf&nbsp;cdecl&nbsp;alias&nbsp;"modf"&nbsp;(byval&nbsp;as&nbsp;double,&nbsp;byval&nbsp;as&nbsp;double&nbsp;ptr)&nbsp;as&nbsp;double&nbsp;
Listing 4.2: Modf Declaration

Notice that the second parameter is defined as byval and the data type is a pointer 
(ptr) to a double-type variable. Remember that byval means “make a copy of the 
contents of the parameter and use it in the function.” If you were to simply use the 
variable name, you would be passing the contents of the memory location, whatever is in 
the variable,and not its address.
When you use a regular variable in your program, you are working with the actual 
data in the memory location associated with the variable. That is, a variable = data. If 
you define myInt as an integer and set it equal to 5, when you print myInt to the screen 
you will see 5. The pointer data type is unique in that what it contains isn't data, that is a 
value like 134, rather it contains the address of a memory location. A pointer = memory 
address. If you were to print a pointer to the screen you would see a number that doesn't 
make much sense, since what you are looking at isn't the data in the memory location, 
but the address of the data in memory.
When you first create a pointer, it doesn't point to anything. This is called a NULL 
pointer. There are a number of ways to initialize the pointer, but one method is to use the 
AddressOf operator. If you create a pointer variable such as myIntPtr you could initialize 
that pointer with code like myIntPtr&nbsp;=&nbsp;@myInt. The @ is the AddressOf operator, and 
this code snippet sets myIntPtr to the address of myInt. In other words, an initialized 
pointer variable and the AddressOf operator both return the same value, a memory 
address.
We can use this concept in the Modf function. Rather than creating a pointer 
variable, we can create a double-type variable and then use this variable with the 
AddressOf operator for the return parameter. Remember that you were able to use 
expressions with the built-in numeric conversion functions. Using the AddressOf operator 
with a variable is an expression which will be evaluated and the result, the variable 
address, will be passed along to the function.
     43

Listing 4.3: addressof.bas

Analysis: In line 1 the crt.bi is included in this program so that all the supported 
functions will be available to the program. In line 5 all of the working variables are 
declared. In line 8, the variable to be operated on is set to a decimal value. The Modf 
function is called in line 11 using the AddressOf operator to retrieve the integer portion of 
the return value. The fractional portion of the return value is loaded into the FracPart 
variable. Line 13 through 15 print out the values returned from the function. The program 
is closed in the usual way in lines 17 and 18.

In line 5 we dimension the variables we will use: myDouble is the value we want to 
convert, FracPart is the value returned by the function and IntPart is the return value that 
will be passed through the second parameter, the pointer. Notice in line 11 we are using 
the AddressOf operator in conjunction with our regular double-type variable.
Here is the output of the program.
myDouble&nbsp;=&nbsp;&nbsp;12.56
Fractional&nbsp;part:&nbsp;0.560000000000001
Integer&nbsp;part:&nbsp;12
Output 4.1: addressof.bas
The return value of the function, .56, is the fractional part and the integer part 12, 
is the value returned through the parameter. The series of zeros ending in a 1 after the 
44


.56 is the result of the precision conversion you will get with a double value. Remember 
in the previous sections it was mentioned that double and single data types are prone to 
rounding errors. Here you see why this is true.

Caution When you are dealing with a pointer parameter, you must be sure to pass 
the correct data type to the parameter. In the case of Modf, it is expecting a double-type 
pointer which is 8 bytes. If you pass the incorrect pointer type to a function, it may not do 
anything at all, or it may try to write to 8 bytes of memory. If the function tries to write to 
more memory than has been allocated you will see the infamous General Protection Fault 
message and your program will be shut down. Always use the proper pointer type with 
pointer parameters. General Protection Fault is a Windows term and is equivalent to a 
Segmentation Fault on Linux.

Testing the Runtime Conversion Functions
As you did with the other conversion functions, you should test these functions 
with both positive and negative numbers to see how they behave.

End

Listing 4.4: crtfunc.bas

Analysis: Since these are C runtime functions, the crt.bi is included in line 2. Line 5 
shows the declaration of the working variables in the program, once again using the 
alternate Dim syntax. Lines 9 through 14 print out the return values of the functions with 
both positive and negative numbers. Lines 17 and 18 close the program.
     45


Line 2 in the program includes the crt.bi which is required for using any of the 
runtime functions. In line 5 the two working double-type variables are dimensioned and 
initialized. As you can see, calling the runtime functions is exactly the same as calling 
any of the FreeBasic built-in functions. Running the program will produce the following 
output.

Ceil&nbsp;with&nbsp;12.56&nbsp;returns&nbsp;&nbsp;13
Ceil&nbsp;with&nbsp;­12.56&nbsp;returns&nbsp;­12

Floor&nbsp;with&nbsp;12.56&nbsp;returns&nbsp;&nbsp;12
Floor&nbsp;with&nbsp;­12.56&nbsp;returns&nbsp;­13
Output 4.2: crtfunc.bas

As you can see in the output, Ceil returns the nearest integer greater than the 
value. 13 is greater than 12 and -12 is less negative than -12.56. Floor does just the 
opposite; it returns the nearest integer less than the value. 12 is less than 12.56 and -13 
is more negative than -12.56. 
A Look Ahead
Normally when you use numbers in your program, you are going to do some sort of 
calculation with them. In the next chapter you will see FreeBasic's arithmetic operators, 
learn about operator precedence and explore the bits that make up a number.

5 Arithmetic Operators
Arithmetic Operators
The Table 6.1 lists all the arithmetic operators in FreeBasic. In the table below, the 
operators will work on two or more expressions, where expression is a number, variable 
or another expression. The square brackets in the syntax column indicate optional 
additional expressions.

Function Syntax Comment
+ (Addition) B = expression + 
expression [ + expression…]

Returns the sum of two or 
more expressions. 
Expression can be a 
number, variable or another 
expression.

- (Subtraction) B = expression – expression 
[ - expression…]

Returns the difference 
between two or more 
expressions.

* (Multiplication) B = expression * expression 
[ * expression…]

Returns the product of two 
or more expressions.

/ (Division) B = expression / expression 
[ / expression…]

Returns the division of two 
or more expression. The 
result implicitly converted to 
the target data type. That is, 
if B is an integer, the result 
will be rounded, if B is a 
double or single, the result 
will be a decimal number.
Note: If the second 
expression evaluates to zero 
(0), then a runtime error will 
occur.

\ (Integer Division) B = expression \ expression 
[ \ expression…]

Returns the integer result of 
division of two or more 
expressions. The result is 
implicitly converted to an 
integer.
Note: If the second 
expression evaluates to zero 
(0), then a runtime error will 
occur.
^ (Exponentiation) B = expression^value Returns the result of raising 
expression to the power of 
value. That is 2^2 = 2*2.
MOD (Modulo) B = expression MOD Returns the remainder of 

48


Function Syntax Comment
expression the implicit division of the 
expressions as an integer 
result. If expression is a 
decimal value, expression is 
rounded before the division.
- (Negation) B = - expression Returns the negated value 
of expression. This is the 
same as multiplying by –1. If 
expression is positive, B will 
negative. If expression is 
negative, B will positive.
( ) (Parenthesis) B = expression operator 
( expression [operator 
expression [ (…])

Forces evaluation of 
expression. Parenthesis can 
be nested, but must be 
closed properly or a compile 
error will occur.

Table 5.1: Arithmetic Operators

You should be familiar with most of these operators from math class. Integer 
division is used when you are not concerned about the remainder of the division process. 
The Mod operator has several uses including executing some code only at certain times, 
and for creating wrap-around functions such as are likely to occur when a sprite reaches 
the edge of the screen and needs to wrap around to the other side.
When using these operators together in single statement, you must b aware of 
how FreeBasic evaluates the expression. For example, does 5 + 6 * 3 equal 33 or does it 
equal 23? FreeBasic evaluates expressions based on precedence rules, that is, rules that 
describe what gets evaluated when. Table 6.2 lists the precedence rules for the 
arithmetic operators. The order of precedence is the same order as the listing; that is the 
top row has the highest precedence, while lower rows have lower precedence.

Operator
( ) (Parenthesis)
^ (Exponentiation)
- (Negation)
*, / (Multiplication and division)
\ (Integer division)
MOD (Modulus)
SHL, SHR (Shift bit left and shift bit right)
+, - (Addition and subtraction)
Table 5.2: Precedence of Arithmetic Operators

     49


The SHL and SHR operators will be discussed in the next section, Bitwise 
Operators. They are included here to show where they fall in the precedence rules.
Looking at the table and the equation 5 + 6 * 3 you can see that this will evaluate 
to 23 not 33, since multiplication has a higher precedence then addition. The compiler 
will read the expression from left to right, pushing values onto an internal stack until it 
can resolve part or all of the equation. For this equation 5 will be read and pushed, then 
the + operator will be read and pushed onto the stack. Since the + operator requires two 
operands, the compiler will read the next element of the expression which will be the * 
operator. This operator also requires two operands, so * will be pushed onto the stack and 
the 3 will be read. Since * takes priority over +, the 6 and 3 will be multiplied, and that 
value will be stored on the stack. At this point there is a 5, + and 18 on the stack. Since 
there is only one operator left and two operands, the 5 and 18 will be added together to 
make 23, which will be returned as the result of the expression.
If you wanted to make sure that 5 + 6 gets evaluated first, then you would use 
parenthesis to force the evaluation. You would write the parenthesized expression as (5 + 
6) * 3. Since the parenthesis have the highest precedence, the expression they contain 
will be evaluated before the multiplication. The evaluation process here is the same as 
the previous process. The ( is treated as an operator and is pushed onto the stack. The 5, 
+, and 6 are read followed by the ). The ) signals the end of the parenthesis operation, so 
the 5 and 6 are added together and pushed onto the stack. The * is read along with the 3. 
The stack at this point contains an 11, * and 3. The 11 and 3 are multiplied together and 
33 is returned as the result of the evaluation.
You can also embed parenthesis within parenthesis. Each time the compiler 
encounters a (, it begins a new parenthesis operation. When it encounters a ), the last ( is 
used to evaluate the items contained within the ( and ) and that result is either placed on 
the stack for further evaluation or returned as a result. Each ( must be match to a ) or a 
compiler error will occur.
The following program demonstrates both implicit evaluation and forced 
evaluation.

Listing 5.1: precedence.bas

50


Analysis: As always we open the program with Option Explicit in line 1 and declare 
the working variables in line 3. In line 6 the compiler evaluates the math expression 
according to precedence rules and stores the result in myInt, which is printed to the 
console window in line 7. In line 10, parenthesis are used to force the evaluation of the 
expression which is printed to the console screen in line 11. Lines 14 and 15 close the 
program in the usual way.

As you can see from the output below, using parenthesis allows you to control the 
evaluation of the expression.

Listing 5.2: sameprecedence.bas

Analysis: In line 3 the working variable myInt is declared, since the program uses 
the Option Explicit directive in line 1. In line 6 the expression has the + operator first and 
the – second, while in line 11 the order has been reversed to test the evaluation order. 
The results are printed in lines 8 and 13. Line 16 and 21 use the * and / operators on the 
same manner to test the order of evaluation and the results are printed in lines 18 and 
23. 

Running the program produces the following result.

Expression&nbsp;1:&nbsp;3&nbsp;+&nbsp;5&nbsp;­&nbsp;4&nbsp;is&nbsp;4
Expression&nbsp;2:&nbsp;3&nbsp;­&nbsp;5&nbsp;+&nbsp;4&nbsp;is&nbsp;2
Expression&nbsp;3:&nbsp;6&nbsp;*&nbsp;2&nbsp;/&nbsp;3&nbsp;is&nbsp;4
Expression&nbsp;4:&nbsp;6&nbsp;/&nbsp;2&nbsp;*&nbsp;3&nbsp;is&nbsp;9
Output 5.2: Output of sameprecedence.bas

As you can see from the output each expression has been evaluated from left to 
right. In expression 1, 3 + 5 is 8 and subtracting 4 equals 4. In expression 2, 3 – 5 is 
equal to -2, and adding 4 equals 2. In expression 3, 6 * 2 is 12 and divide that by 3 and 
you get 4. In expression 4, 6 /2 is 3 and multiplies by 3 results in 9. The program shows 
that operators that have the same precedence level are evaluated from left to right.
This is the case where parenthesis are very helpful in ensuring that the evaluation 
order is according to your program needs. When in doubt, always use parenthesis to 
ensure that the result is what you want in your program.
Shortcut Arithmetic Operators
FreeBasic has a number of shortcut arithmetic operators similar to those found in 
the C programming language. These operators have the same precedence as their single 
counterparts. The following table lists the shortcut operators.

Operator Syntax Comment
+= B += expression Add B to expression and 
assign to B.
-= B -= expression Subtract B to expression 
and assign to B.
*= B *= expression Multiply B to expression and 
assign to B.
/= B /= expression Divide B by expression and 

52


Operator Syntax Comment
assign to B.
\= B \= expression Integer divide B by 
expression and assign to B.
Table 5.3: Shortcut Arithmetic Operators

Using these operators will cut down on the typing you have to do, especially for 
statements such as a&nbsp;=&nbsp;a&nbsp;+&nbsp;1, which can be written as a&nbsp;+=&nbsp;1.
Binary Number System
Computers use the binary, or base 2, numbering system to represent data. Base 2 
digits are the numbers 0 and 1. A single binary 1 or 0 is called a bit. Four bits is called a 
nybble. Two  nybbles, or 8 bits is called a byte and 2 bytes make up a word. The size of a 
data type determines how many bits are available to represent a particular number.  A 
byte has 8 bits, a short has 16 bits, an integer has 32 bits and a longint has 64 bits. 
You will notice that each data type is double the size of the previous data type. 
This is because the binary system uses powers of 2 to represent data. 20 is 1. 21 is 2. 22 is 
4. 23 is 8. 24 is 16, and so on. To find the value of a binary number, you start from the 
right, which is position 0 and add the power of twos going left if there is a 1 in the bit 
position. If a nybble is 1101, then the right-most position is 20, the next position left is 
skipped since it has a zero, followed by 22 and finally 23. Resolving the power terms gives 
you 1 + 4 + 8 which equals 13. The value ranges for the different data types is a direct 
result of the number of bits in each data type.
Being able to manipulate individual bits, bytes and words has a number of uses. 
For example, the messaging system of the Windows API use integers to store both the id 
of a control and event the control received, as the following code snippet shows.

1
2
3

Case&nbsp;WM_COMMAND
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;wmId&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;=&nbsp;Loword(&nbsp;wParam&nbsp;)
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;wmEvent&nbsp;=&nbsp;Hiword(&nbsp;wParam&nbsp;)
Listing 5.3: Snippet from Windows Message Loop

In this snippet the id of the control is stored in the low word of wParam, and the 
event number is stored in the high word. Since a word is 2 bytes or 16 bits, you can store 
65535 ids in a single word, using an unsigned data type, or 32767 ids for a signed data 
type. This is a very efficient way to manage data in your program.
The Sign Bit
The sign bit, the leftmost bit, is used by the computer to determine if a signed data 
type is negative or positive using the Two's Complement form of notation. To represent a 
negative number, the positive value of the number is negated, that is all the 1's are 
changed to 0 and the 0's are changed to 1's, and 1 is added to that result. For example, 
binary 5 is 0000 0101. Negating all the bits results in 1111 1010. Adding 1 results in 1111 
1011. Since the leftmost bit is 1, this is a negative number.
     53


We can confirm this by using the power of 2 notation which results in the following: 
-128 (27) + 64 (26) + 32 (25) + 16 (24) + 8 (23) + 0 + 2 (21) + 1 (20) = - 5. Remember, if 
a bit is zero, we add zero to the total. The following program shows the binary 
representation of both positive 5 and negative five.

Sleep
End
Listing 5.4: signbit.bas

Analysis: Lines 3 and 4 declare the working variables, a byte that will represent the 
actual number and a string that will represent the binary value. In line 6 the myByte is 
set to 5. In line 8 the Bin function is used to return a string that represents the binary 
value of 5. Since Bin does not return any leading 0's, the String function is used to pad 
the string to a full 8 bits for display purposes. 
The first parameter of the String function is the number of characters to add and 
the second parameter is the character to use to pad the string. Since a byte is 8 bits 
long, subtracting the length of myBits from 8 will give the number of 0's to add to the 
string, if the length of myBits is less than 8. In line 12 the numeric value of myByte is 
printed, which is 5. A semi-colon is added to the end of print statement so that Print will 
not print out a carriage return. 
In line 13 the binary string is printed in two groups of four, that is each nybble, to 
make the display easier to read. The Mid function used in line 13 returns a portion of a 
54


string. The first parameter of the Mid function is the string, the second is the start 
position and the third parameter is the number of characters to copy. The first Mid 
returns the first four characters, which is appended to a space using the &amp; operator, 
which in turn is appended to the last four characters.
Line 15 sets myByte to -5 and lines 17 through 22 format the output and display it 
to the screen. The program is ended in the usual manner.

When you run the program the following output is displayed.

myByte&nbsp;=&nbsp;5&nbsp;which&nbsp;is&nbsp;binary&nbsp;0000&nbsp;0101
myByte&nbsp;=­5&nbsp;which&nbsp;is&nbsp;binary&nbsp;1111&nbsp;1011
Output 5.3: Output of signbit.bas

You can see that the output for -5 matches the Two's Complement form. We can 
confirm this by negating 1111 1011 which results in 0000 0100 and adding 1 which 
results in 0000 0101, or positive 5. 
Why is this important? Signed data types have a smaller range of values than 
unsigned data types because a bit is being used to represent the sign of the number. If 
you are needing to store a large number of data values, such as ids, in a byte or integer, 
the number of possible values you can store depends on whether it is signed or 
unsigned. If the number of values needed exceed the range of a signed data type, then 
use an unsigned data type. 
A Look Ahead
There are times when you need to manipulate individual bits and bytes of a 
variable. FreeBasic has a rich set of bitwise operators and macros that you will see in the 
next chapter.

     55


6 Bitwise Operators
FreeBasic includes a number of operators that manipulate the bits of a number. 
The following table lists the bitwise operators in order of their precedence. That is, the 
first row has the highest precedence while lower rows have lower precedence.

Operator Syntax Truth Table Comments
Not (Bitwise negation) B = NOT expression NOT&nbsp;0&nbsp;=&nbsp;1
NOT&nbsp;1&nbsp;=&nbsp;0

or both operand bits is 
1.

Xor (Bitwise 
exclusion)

expression

0&nbsp;XOR&nbsp;0&nbsp;=&nbsp;0
1&nbsp;XOR&nbsp;0&nbsp;=&nbsp;1
0&nbsp;XOR&nbsp;1&nbsp;=&nbsp;1

equivalence)

B = expression EQV 
expression

0&nbsp;EQV&nbsp;0&nbsp;=&nbsp;1
1&nbsp;EQV&nbsp;0&nbsp;=&nbsp;0
0&nbsp;EQV&nbsp;1&nbsp;=&nbsp;0
1&nbsp;EQV&nbsp;1&nbsp;=&nbsp;1

Result bit is 1 if both 
operand bits are 0 or 1.

Imp (Bitwise 
implication)

B = expression IMP 
expression

0&nbsp;IMP&nbsp;0&nbsp;=&nbsp;1
1&nbsp;IMP&nbsp;0&nbsp;=&nbsp;0
0&nbsp;IMP&nbsp;1&nbsp;=&nbsp;1
1&nbsp;IMP&nbsp;1&nbsp;=&nbsp;1

Result bit is 0 if first bit 
is 1 and second bit is 0, 
otherwise result is 1.

Table 6.1: Bitwise Operators

The truth table column indicates the operation on the individual bits. The order of 
the bits are not important except for the IMP operator which tests the bits of the second 
operand using the bits from the first operand.

Listing 6.1: not.bas

Analysis: In line 3 the working variable myByte is declared and initialized using the 
alternate format of the Dim statement. Line 6 prints out the value of myByte in both 
decimal and binary. In line 8 the NOT operator is used to negate all the bits in the integer. 
The result of the operation is printed to the console window in line 10. In line 12, 1 is 
added to the result as required by the two's complement method. The result of this 
operation id printed in line 14. The program is closed in the usual way.

When the program is run, you should see the following output.

myByte:&nbsp;5&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Binary:&nbsp;101
NOT&nbsp;myByte:&nbsp;­6&nbsp;Binary:&nbsp;11111010
myByte&nbsp;+&nbsp;1:&nbsp;­5&nbsp;&nbsp;Binary:&nbsp;11111011
Output 6.1: Output of not.bas

 As you can see from the output, the final result of the program is -5 after applying 
the twos complement method to myByte. The 1 in the leftmost position indicates that the 
number is negative. Bin doesn't add the leading zeros in the first output line, but the 
three digits shown are the rightmost three digits.
The AND Operator
The AND operator can be used to test if an individual bit is 1 or 0 by using a mask 
value to test for the bit position as the following program illustrates.

Listing 6.2: and.bas

Analysis: In line 5 the working variables are declared and initialized. The first 
section of the program is testing for the third bit position of myByte, which is bit 22, or 
decimal 4. Lines 8 through 10 print out the heading, decimal and binary values for the 
variables. The If statement in line 13 uses the AND operator to test for a 1 in the 3rd bit 
position, and since binary 5 contains a one in this position, the program will execute the 
code immediately following the Then keyword.
Line 21 sets the mask value to 2 to test for a 1 in the second bit position, which is 
21 or 2. Line 23 through 25 print out the header, decimal and binary values of the 
variables. :ine 28 uses the AND operator to test for a 1, and since binary 5 has a 0 in this 
position, the program will execute the code immediately following hr Else keyword.

Running the program produces the following output.

2nd&nbsp;bit&nbsp;is&nbsp;0
Listing 6.3: Output of and.bas

Looking at the binary values you can see how the bits line up and how the AND 
operator can test for individual bits. 5 in binary has a bit set in the 20 (1) and 22 (4) 
position. Setting the mask value to 4 sets bit position 22 to 1 and all other bit positions to 
0. The expression (myByte&nbsp;And&nbsp;Mask) will return an integer value that will contain the 
AND values of the two operands. Since the mask has zeros in every position except for 
the 22 position, all of the other bits will be masked out, that is 0, returning a 4. Since the 
return value of 4 matches the target value 4, the code following the Then clause is 
executed.
The second portion of the program test for the 21 position of myByte. Since this 
position contains a 0 in myByte, the value returned from the expression (myByte&nbsp;And&nbsp;
Mask) does not match the target value, so the code following the Else clause if executed. 
The OR Operator
You can use the OR operator to set multiple values in a single variable. The 
Windows API uses this technique to set flags for objects such as the styles of a window. 
The following program illustrates this concept.

Listing 6.4: or.bas

Analysis: Line 4 declares the working variables. In line 7, myByte is set to 2 and in 
line 8, that value is combined with 4 using the OR operator. Lines 10 and 11 print out the 
decimal and binary values of myByte. In line 14, the mask is set to 2 and in lines 18 
through 22 the AND operator is used to test for 2 in myByte. Since myByte contains a 2, 
the program will execute the code immediately following the Then clause. Lines 24 
through 31 use the same procedure to test for the value of 4. Since myByte contains a 4, 
the program will print out the text “myByte contains a 4”. In lines 34 through 41, myByte 
is tested for 8, which is does not contains so the code in line 40 will be executed.

When you run the program, you should get the following output.

60


myByte&nbsp;set&nbsp;to&nbsp;2&nbsp;and&nbsp;4
myByte:&nbsp;6&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Binary:&nbsp;110

Testing&nbsp;for&nbsp;4
myByte&nbsp;contains&nbsp;4

Testing&nbsp;for&nbsp;8
myByte&nbsp;doesn't&nbsp;contain&nbsp;8
Output 6.2: Output of or.bas

As you can see from the output, you can pack multiple values into a single 
variable. The number of values a variable can contain depends on the size of data type 
and the range of values. Using the OR and AND combination is a technique that you will 
find in wide-spread use, especially in third-party libraries, as it provides an efficient way 
to pass multiple data items using a single variable.
The XOR Operator
One of the more useful aspects of the XOR operator is to flip bits between two 
states. XORing a value with 0 will return the original value, and XORing with a 1 returns 
the opposite value. Suppose that you start with a 1 bit and XOR with a 0 bit. Since the 
two inputs are different you will get a 1. If the start value is 0 and you XOR with a 0, then 
both values are the same and you will get a 0. In both cases the output is the same as 
the input. If you start with a 1 and XOR with a 1, you will get a 0 since both inputs are the 
same. If you start with a 0 and XOR with a 1, you will get a 1 since the inputs are 
different. Here the inputs have been flipped to the opposite values. You can use this 
technique with a mask value, XORing once to get a new value, and then XORing again 
with the same mask to get the original value.
One use of this technique is to display a sprite on the screen using XOR and then 
erasing the sprite by using another XOR at the same location. The first XOR combines the 
bits of the background with the sprite bits to display the image. Another XOR in the same 
location flips the bits back to their original state, once again showing the background and 
effectively erasing the sprite image.
XOR can also be used to swap the values of two variables as demonstrated in the 
following program.

Listing 6.5: xor.bas

Analysis: In line 3 the working variables are declared and initialized. Line 5 prints 
out the initial variable values. Lines 7 through 9 carry out the XOR operation. In line 7, 
MyInt1 is XORed with myInt2 to get an intermediate value which is stored in myInt1. In 
line 8, the XOR operation returns the original value of myInt1 which is stored in myInt2. 
The third XOR operation in line 9 then returns the value of myInt2 from the intermediate 
value that was stored in myInt1 in line 7. Line 10 prints out the swapped values and the 
program is then closed in the usual way.

Running the program produces the following output.

myInt1&nbsp;=&nbsp;&nbsp;5&nbsp;myInt2&nbsp;=&nbsp;&nbsp;10
Swapping&nbsp;values...
myInt1&nbsp;=&nbsp;&nbsp;10&nbsp;myInt2&nbsp;=&nbsp;&nbsp;5
Output 6.3: Output of xor.bas

As you can see the program was able to swap the two values without using a 
temporary variable because the XOR operator is able to flip the bits between two distinct 
states. 
The EQV Operator

if two expressions are equivalent as the following program demonstrates.

End
Listing 6.6: eqv.bas
Analysis: In lines 3 and 4, the values False and True are defined. FreeBasic uses -1 
to indicate a True result from a logical operation such as that performed when executing 
an If statement. Since False is defined as 0, NOT False flips all the bits to 1, including the 
sign bit, making -1. 
In line 6 the working variables are declared and initialized. Lines 12 through 18 test 
the first expression. The If statement in line 13 will execute the first expression, (myInt1 
&lt; 5). Since 4 &lt; 5 this will return True. The EQV operator has lower precedence then 
(myInt2 &gt; 1), so this will be evaluated, and since 2 &gt; 1 then will also return true. This 
leaves -1 EQV -1 to be evaluated. Since -1 is equivalent to -1, the whole statement is 
True. In line 22, both of the expressions are False. 0 EQV 0 is True, so this statement is 
also True and will print out the affirmative. In line 32, the first expression is True while the 
second is False. Since -1 is not equivalent to 0, this statement will evaluate to False and 
the negative will be printed.

When the program is run, you will see the following output.

     63


myInt1&nbsp;=&nbsp;&nbsp;4&nbsp;myInt2&nbsp;=&nbsp;&nbsp;2

Statement&nbsp;(myInt1&nbsp;&lt;&nbsp;5)&nbsp;eqv&nbsp;(myInt2&nbsp;&gt;&nbsp;1)&nbsp;is&nbsp;equivalent.

Statement&nbsp;(myInt1&nbsp;&gt;&nbsp;5)&nbsp;eqv&nbsp;(myInt2&nbsp;&lt;&nbsp;1)&nbsp;is&nbsp;equivalent.

Statement&nbsp;(myInt1&nbsp;&gt;&nbsp;5)&nbsp;eqv&nbsp;(myInt2&nbsp;&lt;&nbsp;1)&nbsp;is&nbsp;not&nbsp;equivalent.
Listing 6.7: Output of eqv.bas

It is important to realize that you are not testing to see if the expressions are True 
or False. You are only testing to see if the expressions are equivalent to each other. To put 
it another way, you are testing to see if two assertions are equivalent to each other. For 
example, suppose you have two characters in a game and you want to attack with both 
characters, if they are at equivalent strength. You could build an expression similar to the 
one in the listing and take action based on the equivalence of the two characters.
The IMP Operator
Like the EQV operator, IMP is rarely used as a bitwise operator. It is used in logic 
programming to test whether assertion A implies assertion B. Looking at the truth table 
we can see that a True assertion implies a True conclusion so True and True is also True. A 
True assertion however cannot imply a False conclusion so True and False is False. A False 
premise can imply any conclusion so False with any conclusion is always True. Unless you 
are building an expert system or natural language interface, you will probably never need 
to use this operator.

Caution Exercise caution when using bitwise operators with arithmetic operators, 
as the result may not be what you expect. When used in logical expressions, such as in 
an If statement, make sure the bitwise operators operate on either the True or False 
values of complete expressions to avoid evaluation problems. 

Shortcut Bitwise Operators
The bitwise operators, like the arithmetic operators, can be written in shorthand 
form. The following table lists the shortcut versions of the bitwise operators.

And= B And= C This is the same as B = B 
And C.
Or= B Or= C This is the same as B = B Or

Table 6.2: Shortcut Bitwise Operators
The SHL and SHR Operators
SHL stands for shift left and SHR stands for shift right. As the names imply, these 
operators shift the bits of a byte or integer-type variable either left or right. The following 
table shows the syntax diagram of both operators.

Operator Syntax Comments
SHL (Shift bits left) B = variable SHL 
number

Shifts the bits of variable left number of 
places.

SHR (Shift bits right) B = variable SHR 
number

Shifts the bits of variable right number of 
places.

Table 6.3: SHL and SHR Operators

Shifting left is the same as multiplying by 2 and shifting right is the same as 
dividing by 2. You can see this by looking at the binary representation of a number. Take 
the byte value of 1 which is 0000 0001. The 1 is in the 20 position. 20 equals 1. Shifting 
the bit left, makes 0000 0010, putting the 1 bit in the 21 position, which evaluates to 2. 
This is the same as 1*2. Shifting left again puts the bit at the 22 position, 0000 0100 
which evaluates to 4, or 2 *2. Shifting the bit right puts the 1 back in the 21 position, 
0000 0010, which evaluates to 2, or 4/2. Shifting right again puts the 1 bit in the 20 
position, 0000 0001, which is 1 or 2/2.
The shift operation can be used as a replacement for multiplication or division if 
you are working with powers of 2, but it is primarily used to pack data items into 
variables, or to retrieve data items from variables. You saw this demonstrated in the 
MAKDWORD macro which was defined as #define&nbsp;MAKDWORD(x,y)&nbsp;(cint(x)&nbsp;shl&nbsp;16&nbsp;or&nbsp;
cint(y)). 
In this macro, the value of x is converted to an integer, and then shifted left 16 bits 
into the high word. An integer is 4 bytes and can be represented as 00000000  00000000 
00000000 00000001 . Shifting 16 bits left makes  00000000  00000001 00000000 
00000000. Remember that a word is two bytes, so the 1 has been shifted to the high 
word of the integer. You can then use the Hiword function to retrieve this value.
The following program shows the SHL and SHR operators.

Listing 6.8: shlr.bas

Analysis: Line declares the working variables, myInt which will be he value that is 
shifted, and i for use in the For-Next loop. Line 8 through 11 shift myInt left 16 times, 1 bit 
position each time, and prints the result. Line 15 through 19 then shift the variable right 
16 times and prints the result. The program is closed in the usual way.

Running the program produces the following output.

right divides the value by 2. 
Bitwise Macros
FreeBasic has several built-in macros for retrieving and setting bit and byte data 
from a variable. The following tables lists the macros, the syntax and their definitions.

Macro Syntax Definition
Hiword B = Hiword(variable) #define Hiword(x) (CUInt(x) shr 16)
Loword B = Loword(variable) #define Loword(x) (CUInt(x) and 65535)
Hibyte B = Hibyte(variable) #define Hibyte(x) ((CUint(x) and 65280) 
shr 8)
Lobyte B = Lobyte(variable) #define Lobyte( x ) ( CUint( x ) and 255 )
Bit B = Bit( variable, bit_number 
)

#define Bit( x, bit_number ) (((x) and (1 
shl (bit_number))) &gt; 0)

Bitset B = Bitset(variable, 
bit_number)

Table 6.4: Bitwise Macros

The Hiword macro returns the leftmost two bytes of an integer and the Loword 
macro returns the the rightmost two bytes. The Hibyte macro returns the leftmost eight 
bits of a an integer and the Lobyte returns the rightmost eight bits.
The Bit macro returns a -1 if a bit at position bit_number is a 1, otherwise it returns 
a 0. The Bitset macro sets the bit at position bit_number to 1 and returns the number, 
and the Bitreset macro sets the bit at position bit_number to 0 and returns the number. 
The rightmost bit is bit 0 following the binary numbering scheme.

Caution Bitwise operators will only work correctly on byte and integer-type data. A 
single or double-type variable that is passed to a bitwise operator will be implicitly 
converted to an integer,  which may result in precision loss.

     67


These macros are useful when working with third party libraries such as the 
Windows API, where several pieces of information are stored in a single data type. 
A Look Ahead
In addition to the arithmetic and bitwise operators, FreeBasic has a set of 
mathematical functions which is the subject of the next chapter.

7 Mathematical Functions
FreeBasic has a number of mathematical functions which are listed in the following 
table.

Function Syntax Comments
ABS (Absolute Value) B = Abs(expression) Returns the unsigned value of expression. 
This is an overloaded function so 
expression can resolve to an integer, 
longint or double.
ACOS (ArcCosine) B = 
Acos(expression)

Returns the ArcCosine of a double-type 
expression in radians. Expression must be 
in the range of -1 to 1.
ASIN (ArcSine) B = Asin(expression) Returns the ArcSine of a double-type 
expression in radians. Expression must be 
in the range of -1 to 1.
ATAN2 (ArcTangent of 
Ratio)

B = 
Atan2(expressionV, 
expressionH)

Returns the ArcTangent of of ratio of 
double-type expression1 / expression2 in 
radians. ExpressionV is the vertical 
component and expressionH is the 
horizontal component, where both 
expressions are double-type values.

ATAN (ArcTangent) B = 
Atan(expression)

Returns the ArcTangent of a double-type 
expression in radians. Expression must be 
in the range of -Pi/2 to Pi/2.

COS (Cosine) B = Cos(expression) Returns the Cosine of a double-type 
expression in radians. Expression must be 
in the range of -1 to 1 and is the angle 
measured in radians.
EXP (E Exponent) B = Exp(expression) Returns e (approx 2.716) raised to the 
power of a double-type expression.
LOG (Logarithm) B = Log(expression) Returns the natural Logarithm (base e) of 
a double-type expression. 
SGN (Sign) B = Sgn(expression) Returns the sign of a double-type 
expression. If expression is greater than 0 
then Sgn returns a 1. If expression is 0, 
then Sgn returns 0. If expression is less 
than 0, then Sgn return -1.
SIN (Sine) B = Sin(expression) Returns the Sine of a double-type 
expression in radians. Expression must be 
in the range -1 to 1.
SQR (Square Root) B = Sqr(expression) Returns the square root of a double-type 

     69


Function Syntax Comments
expression. Expression must be greater 
than or equal to 0.
TAN (Tangent) B = Tan(expression) Returns the Tangent of a double-type 
expression in radians. Expression is the 
angle measured in radians.
Table 7.1: Mathematical Functions
Trigonometric Functions
All of the trigonometric functions return the measured angle in radians not 
degrees. To convert degrees to radians you would use the formula radian = degree * PI / 
180. To convert radians to degrees you would use the formula degree = radian * 180 / PI. 
PI is the ratio of the circumference of a circle to its diameter and can be calculated using 
the Atn function with the formula PI = 4 * Atn(1.0). The following short program converts 
an angle in degrees to an angle in radians.

There are a number of on-line tutorials that you can access to brush up on your trig. A 
quick Google search on the term trigonometry brought up hundreds of sites that offer 
basic to advanced tutorials on the various trig functions that FreeBasic supports. Randy 
Keeling has written two basic tutorials on trigonometry in the Community Tutorials 
section  of the FreeBasic wiki. At the time of this writing, the wiki was located at 
http://www.freebasic.net/wiki/wikka.php?wakka=FBWiki.

Absolute Value and the Sgn Function
You would use the Abs function when you are interested in the absolute magnitude 
of a number. The absolute value of a number is the distance that number is from zero on 
the real number line. 3 is three units from 0 so its absolute magnitude is 3. -3 is also 
three units from 0 so its absolute magnitude is also 3.
The Sgn function, called the signum function in math, is related to the Abs function 
since you can express the absolute value of a number by using the Sgn function. Sgn 
returns -1 for a negative number, 0 for 0 and 1 for a positive number. To calculate the 
absolute value of a number you would use the formula |a| = a * Sgn(a), where the 
vertical lines indicate absolute value. If we replace a with -3 in the formula, you get |-3| = 
-3 * Sgn(-3), or |-3| = -3 * -1. Since multiplying a negative with a negative returns a 
positive, the result is |-3| = 3.  Replacing a with 3, the formula would evaluate to |3| = 3 * 
1, or |3| = 3.
One use of the Sgn function in programming is determining the relative positions 
of two points on the screen. If you have two points, A(5, 6,) and B(3, 4), where the first 
number is the row and the second number is the column, you can determine the relative 
position by moving the origin to point A and looking at the sign of point B. The origin (0, 
0) of the screen is located in the upper left corner. To move the origin to point A you need 
to subtract 5 from the row and 6 from the column of each point giving A(0, 0) and B(-2, 
-2). You can now use the Sgn function on the row and column components of B.

? If Sgn(B.row) = -1, then the row is above A.
? If Sgn(B.row) = 0, then the row is in the same row as A.
? If Sgn(B.row) = 1 then the row is below A.
? If Sgn(B.column) = -1 then the column is to the left of A.
? If Sgn(B.column) = 0 then the column is in the same column as A.
? If Sgn(B.column) = -1 then the column is to the right of A.

     71


Since B is located at row -2 and column -2 after adjusting the origin, the Sgn 
function will return -1 for the row and -1 for the column. This puts point B above and to 
the left of of point A.
Logarithms
Logarithmshave a wide range of uses in mathematics, physics and biology. For 
example, the decay rate of radioactive particles is logarithmic in nature. Logarithms are a 
way of expressing exponentiation. For the following formula Ab = x can be expressed as 
Log(x) = b where the base of the log is a. The two most commonly used logarithms are 
the natural log, which uses e (2.7182818284590452354...) as the base, and log base 10 
or the common log. The Log function in FreeBasic uses the natural log, but any log base 
can be expressed by the formula logarithm = Log(number) / Log(base)2.
One property of logarithms is that they can be used to multiply or divide two 
numbers together. This was a common use of logarithms before the invention of 
calculators. The following program uses the logarithm method to multiply two numbers 
together.

Analysis: Line 3 defines a symbolic constant, base10, that will be the base of the 
logarithm calculations. Using a constant in this manner reduces the number of 
calculations the program must perform. Instead of using two Log(10) function calls, only 
one is used in the constant definition. Line 5 declares the working variables, l1 an l2 
which are the two Logarithms of the numbers 2.5 and 5.6 and the sum of the logs, lt. al 
will be the antilog value.
Lines 8 and 10 calculate the base 10 log of the two numbers. In line 13 the 
logs are added together. Line 17 calculates the antilog, which is the base, in this case 10, 
raised to the power of the sum of the logs. Line 20 prints the result using the 
multiplication operator, and line 21 prints the result using the log method.
The program is closed in the usual way in lines 23 and 24.

Running the program produces the following result.

2.5&nbsp;*&nbsp;5.6&nbsp;=&nbsp;&nbsp;14
Log&nbsp;method&nbsp;=&nbsp;&nbsp;14
Output 7.2: Output of log.bas

As you can see from the output, adding the logarithms of the two numbers and 
then calculating the antilog of the sum produces the same result as multiplying the two 
numbers.
The C Runtime Library Math Constants and Functions
The C Runtime Library (CRT) has a number of math constants and functions that 
you can use in your programs. To use these functions you would add the line #Include&nbsp;
Once&nbsp;“crt.bi” to your program. The following table lists the math constants available in 
math.bi.

root of two which is also the 
square root of 1/2.
Table 7.2: CRT Math Constants

In the example programs the value of PI was calculated. However, as you can see, 
the value of PI is available in the CRT, so it is much more efficient to use the defined 
value M_PI in your programs, rather than making the compiler perform a calculation for 
the value. The same reasoning applies to the base 10 logarithm calculation that was used 
in log.bas. Instead of calculating the base 10 log you can use the constant value M_LN10.
The various versions of the PI constants are commonly used values in calculations 
as are the versions of the square root of 2. The square root of 2, like PI, is an irrational 
number and is the length of the hypotenuse of a right triangle with sides that have a unit 
length of 1. The square root of 2 is related to PI with the formula sqrt(2)=2sin(PI/4). The 
following program displays both the calculated value of the square root of 2 and the CRT 
value for comparison.

Listing 7.3: sr2.bas

Analysis: Line 3 includes the CRT declaration file, crt.bi, which will enable the 
program to use the math constants and functions. The #Include&nbsp;Once directive ensures 
that the file is only included once in the program, even if other modules also include the 
file. Line 5 declares the working variable which will hold the result of the calculation in 
Line 7. Line 9 and 10 displays the calculated value as well as the CRT defined value for 
comparison. The program is closed in the usual way.

When you run the program you should see the following output.

Calculated&nbsp;Square&nbsp;root&nbsp;of&nbsp;2:&nbsp;1.41421356237309
CRT&nbsp;value:&nbsp;1.4142135623731
Output 7.3: Output of sr2.bas

As you can see from the output, the calculated value has a slightly higher precision 
than the constant value, but the difference is too small to really matter in most cases. To 
save the compiler a calculation, and thereby speeding up your program, use the defined 
value in the CRT.
Selected CRT Math Functions
There are a number of math functions declared in the CRT. Table 8.3 list three of 
the functions.

Hypot B = Hypot(x as double, y as 
double)

Hypot returns the 
hypotenuse of sides x and y.
Log10 B = Log10(x as double) Log10 returns the base 10 
log of x.
Pow B = Pow(base as double,

function log10. Line 13 adds the logarithms, which is the same as multiplying the two 
numbers, and saves the result in the variable lt. In line 17 the Pow function is used rather 
than the exponentiation operator to calculate the antilog. Lines 20 and 21 print out the

Using the CRT functions can make your program a bit more simple, and a bit less 
error prone. Since FreeBasic uses the Microsoft runtime library the functions are stable 
and reliable, and many include optimizations that make the functions perform better than 
you could achieve by hand coding.
A Look Ahead
In addition to the standard numeric variables, FreeBasic also has the pointer data 
type, which is the subject of the next chapter.
76


8 Pointer Data Type
The pointer data type is unique among the FreeBasic numeric data types. Instead 
of containing data, like the other numeric types, a pointer contains the memory address 
of data. On a 32-bit system, the pointer data type is 4 bytes. FreeBasic uses pointers for a 
number of functions such as ImageCreate, and pointers are used heavily in external 
libraries such as the Windows API. Pointers are also quite fast, since the compiler can 
directly access the memory location that a pointer points to. A proper understanding of 
pointers is essential to effective programming in FreeBasic.
For many beginning programmers, pointers seem like a strange and mysterious 
beast. However, if you keep one rule in mind, you should not have any problems using 
pointers in your program. The rule is very simple: a pointer contains an address, not data. 
If you keep this simple rule in mind, you should have no problems using pointers.
Pointers and Memory
You can think of the memory in your computer as a set of post office boxes (P.O. 
Box) at your local post office. When you go in to rent a P.O. Box, the clerk will give you a 
number, such as 100. This is the address of your P.O. Box. You decide to write the number 
down an a slip of paper and put it in your wallet. The next day you go to the post office 
and pull out the slip of paper. You locate box 100 and look inside the box and find a nice 
stack of junk mail. Of course, you want to toss the junk mail, but there isn't a trash can 
handy, so you decide to just put the mail back in the box and toss it later. Working with 
pointers in FreeBasic is very similar to using a P.O. Box.
When you declare a pointer, it isn't pointing to anything which is analogous to the 
blank slip of paper. In order to use a pointer, it must be initialized to a memory address, 
which is the same as writing down the number 100 on the slip of paper.  Once you have 
the address, find the right P.O. Box, you can dereference the pointer, open the mail box, 
to add or retrieve data from the pointed-to memory location. As you can see there are 
three basic steps to using pointers.
1. Declare a pointer variable.
2. Initialize the pointer to a memory address.
3. Dereference the pointer to manipulate the data at the pointed-to memory location.
This isn't really any different than using a standard variable, and you use pointers 
in much the same way as standard variables. The only real difference between the two is 
that in a standard variable, you can access the data directly, and with a pointer you must 
dereference the pointer to interact with the data. The following program illustrates the 
above steps.

Listing 8.1: basicpointer.bas

Analysis: In line 4 a pointer to an integer is created. The pointer doesn't point to a 
memory location yet, and if you were to try and use this uninitialized pointer, you would 
generate an error. Line 7 uses the Callocate function to set aside memory equal to the 
size of an integer, that is 4 bytes, and returns the starting address of the memory 
segment. The second parameter passed to Callocate is the size of the memory unit to 
allocate. The first parameter is the number of units to allocate. In this program, one unit 
of size integer is being allocated. 
Now that myPointer has been initialized, you can use it. Line 9 prints out contents 
of myPointer which illustrates that the variable contains a memory address and not data. 
In line 11 data is added to the memory location using the indirection operator *. The 
indirection operator tells the compiler you want to work with the data that myPointer is 
pointing to, rather than the memory address contained in the variable. Line 13 prints out 
the contents of the memory location which is now 10. 
In line 15, the memory allocated with Callocate is freed using the Deallocate 
procedure. The program is closed in the usual way.

Running the program should produce a result similar to the following output.

Pointer&nbsp;address:3089536
Memory&nbsp;location&nbsp;contains:&nbsp;10
Output 8.1: Output of basicpointer.bas

The address printed on your computer will probably be different, since the 
operating system allocates the memory used by Callocate.

When your program terminates, all memory that was allocated in the program is freed 
and returned to the operating system. However, it is good practice to deallocate 
memory when it is no longer needed, even if it isn't strictly necessary when a program 
terminates. The better you manage your program's memory, the less chance of 
problems you will have when running the program on different computer configurations.

78


Typed and Untyped Pointers
FreeBasic has two types of pointers, typed and untyped. The preceding program 
declared a typed pointer, Dim&nbsp;myPointer&nbsp;as&nbsp;Integer&nbsp;Ptr, which tells the compiler that 
this pointer will be used for integer data. Using typed pointers allows the compiler to do 
type checking to make sure that you are not using the wrong type of data with the 
pointer, and simplifies pointer arithmetic.
Untyped pointers are declared using the Any keyword: Dim&nbsp;myPointer&nbsp;as&nbsp;Any&nbsp;
Ptr Untyped pointers have no type checking and default to size of byte. Untyped pointers 
are used in the C Runtime Library and many third party libraries, such as the Win32 API, 
to accommodate the void pointer type in C. You should use typed pointers so that the 
compiler can check the pointer assignments, unless working with libraries that require 
the void pointer.
Pointer Operators
There are two pointer operators in FreeBasic; the indirection operator and the 
addressof operator.

Operator Syntax Comment
* (Indirection)
[ ] (Index Access)

B = *myPointer
*myPointer = B
B = myPointer[index]
myPointer[index] = B

You can access the data in a 
pointer memory location by 
either using the indirection 
operator or using index 
access. The index format 
uses the size of the data 
type to determine the 
proper indexing. 

@ (AddressOf) myPointer = @myVar
myPointer = @mySub()
myPointer = @myFunction()

Returns the memory 
address of a variable, 
subroutine or function. 

Table 8.1: Pointer Operators

You will notice that the addressof operator not only returns the memory address of 
a variable, but it can also return the address of a subroutine or function. You would use 
the address of a subroutine or function to create a callback function such as used in the 
CRT function qsort. Callback functions will discussed later in this chapter.
Memory Functions
FreeBasic has a number of memory allocation functions that are used with 
pointers, as shown in the following table.

Function Syntax Comment
Allocate myPointer = 
Allocate(number_of_bytes)

Allocates number_of_bytes 
and returns the memory

address. If myPointer is 0, 
the memory could not be 
allocated. The allocated 
memory segment is not 
cleared and contains 
undefined data.
Callocate myPointer =

nts, size_of_elements)

Callocate allocates 
number_of_elements that 
have size_of_elements and 
returns the memory 
address. If the memory 
could not be allocated, 
Callocate will return 0. The 
memory segment allocated 
is cleared.
Deallocate Deallocate myPointer Frees the memory segment 
pointed to by myPointer.
Reallocate myPointer = 
Reallocate(pointer, 
number_of_bytes)

Reallocate changes the size 
of a memory segment 
created with Allocate or 
Callocate. If the new size is 
larger than the existing 
memory segment, the 
contents of the memory 
segment remained 
unchanged. If the new size 
is smaller, the contents of 
the memory segment are 
truncated. If pointer is 0, 
Reallocate behaves just like 
Allocate. A 0 is returned if 
the memory segment 
cannot be changed.

Table 8.2: FreeBasic Memory Functions

These functions are useful for creating a number of dynamic structures such as 
linked lists, ragged or dynamic arrays and buffers used with third party libraries. 
When using the Allocate function you must specify the storage size based on the 
data type using the equation number_of_elements&nbsp;*&nbsp;Sizeof(datatype). To allocate 
space for 10 integers your code would look like this: myPointer&nbsp;=&nbsp;Allocate(10&nbsp;*&nbsp;
Sizeof(Integer)). An integer is 4 bytes so allocating 10 integers will set aside 40 bytes 
of memory. Allocate does not clear the memory segment, so any data in the segment will 
be random, meaningless data until it is initialized.
Callocate works in the same fashion, except that the calculation is done internally. 
To allocate the same 10 integers using Callocate your code would look like this: 
myPointer&nbsp;=&nbsp;Callocate(10,&nbsp;Sizeof(Integer)). Unlike Allocate, Callocate will clear 
the memory segment.
80


Reallocate will change the size of an existing memory segment, making it larger or 
smaller as needed. If the new segment is larger than the existing segment, then the data 
in the existing segment will be preserved. If the new segment is smaller than the existing 
segment, the data in the existing segment will be truncated. Reallocate does not clear 
the added memory or change any existing data.
All of these functions will return a memory address if successful. If the functions 
cannot allocate the memory segment, then a NULL pointer (0) is returned. You should 
check the return value each time you use these functions to be sure that the memory 
segment was successfully created. Trying to use a bad pointer will result in undesirable 
behavior or system crashes.
There is no intrinsic method for determining the size of an allocation; you must 
keep track of this information yourself.

Caution Be careful not to use the same pointer variable to allocate two or more 
memory segments. Reusing a pointer without first deallocating the segment it points to 
will result in the memory segment being lost causing a memory leak.

Pointer Arithmetic and Pointer Indexing
When you create a memory segment using the allocation functions, you will need a 
way to access the data contained within the segment. In FreeBasic there are two 
methods for accessing data in the segment; using the indirection operator with pointer 
arithmetic, and pointer indexing. 
Pointer arithmetic, as the name suggests, adds and subtracts values to a pointer to 
access individual elements within a memory segment. When you create a typed pointer 
such as Dim&nbsp;myPointer&nbsp;as&nbsp;Integer&nbsp;ptr, the compiler knows that the data being used 
with this pointer is of size Integer or 4 bytes. The pointer, when initialized, points to the 
first element of the segment. You can express this as *(myPtr + 0). To access the second 
element, you need to add 1 to the pointer, which can be expressed as *(myPtr + 1). 
Since the compiler knows that the pointer is an Integer pointer, adding 1 to the pointer 
reference will actually increment the address contained in myPtr by 4, the size of an 
Integer. This is why using typed pointers is preferable over untyped pointers. The 
compiler does much of the work for you in accessing the data in the memory segment.
Notice that the construct is *(myPtr + 1) and not *myPtr + 1. The * operator has 
higher precedence than +, so *myPtr + 1 will actually increment the contents myPtr 
points to, and not the pointer address.  *myPtr will be evaluated first, which returns the 
contents of the memory location and then +1 will be evaluated, adding 1 to the memory 
location. By wrapping myPtr + 1 within parenthesis, you force the compiler to evaluate 
myPtr + 1 first, which increments the pointer address, and then the * is applied to return 
the contents of the new address.
Pointer indexing works the same way as pointer arithmetic, but the details are 
handled by the compiler. *(myPtr + 1) is equivalent to myPtr[1]. Again, since the 
compiler knows that myPtr is an integer pointer, it can calculate the correct memory 
offsets to return the proper values using the index. Which format you use if up to you, but 
most programmers use the index method because of its simplicity.
The following program shows both methods of accessing a memory segment.

Listing 8.2: ptraccess.bas

Analysis: In lines 3 and 4 the working variables are declared. Space for 10 integers 
is created in Line 7 using the Callocate function. Lines 10 through 13 check to make sure 
that the memory was allocated. If it wasn't, the program ends. The End 1 terminates the 
program with an exit code of 1. This is useful for instances where the program may be 
run from a batch file and you want to make sure the program ran successfully. You can 
check the exit code in the batch file and take the appropriate action.
Lines 17 through 20 load and print the memory segment with ten integers using 
the indirection operator and pointer arithmetic. Lines 25 through 27 print out the values 
using the index method. Notice that the index method is much more compact and easier 
to read. In line 30 the buffer is deallocated, even though it isn't strictly necessary as the 
program is terminating. Deallocating memory is a good habit to get into, even when it 
may not be strictly necessary. The program is closed in the usual way.

When you run the program you should see the following output.

Output 8.2: Output of ptraccess.bas

As you can see from the output, both formats produce the same results, but the 
index method is a lot easier to read and understand, and less error-prone than the 
indirection method.
Pointer Functions
Freebasic has a set of pointer functions to complement the pointer operators. The 
following table lists the pointer functions.

Cptr myPtr = Cptr(data_type, 
expression)

Converts expression to a 
data_type pointer. 
Expression can be another 
     83


Function Syntax Comment
pointer or an integer.
Peek B = Peek(data_type, 
pointer)

Peek returns the contents of 
memory location pointer to 
by pointer. Data_type 
specifies the type of 
expected data.

Poke Poke data_type, pointer, 
expression

Puts the value of expression 
into the memory location 
pointed to by pointer. The 
data_type specifies the type 
of data being placed into 
the memory location.

Sadd myPtr = 
Sadd(string_variable)

Returns the location in 
memory where the string 
data in a dynamic string is 
located.

Strptr myPtr = 
Strptr(string_variable)

The same as Sadd.

Procptr myPtr = Procptr(function) Returns the address of a 
function. This works the 
same way as the addressof 
operator @.
Varptr myPtr = Varptr(variable) This function works the 
same way as the addressof 
operator @.
Table 8.3: Pointer Functions

The Sadd and Strptr functions will be discussed in the chapter on the string data 
types. The Peek and Poke functions have been added for the purposes of supporting 
legacy code. Procptr and Varptr both work just like the address of operator, but Proptr 
only works on subroutines and functions and Varptr only works on variables. Cptr is useful 
for casting an untyped pointer to a typed pointer, such as a return value from a third 
party library.
Subroutine and Function Pointers
Subroutines and functions, like variables, reside in memory and have an address 
associated with their entry point. You can use these addresses to create events in your 
programs, to create pseudo-objects and are used in callback functions. You create a sub 
or function pointer just like any other pointer except you declare your variable as a 
pointer to a subroutine or function rather than as a pointer to a data type. Before using a 
function pointer, it must be initialized to the address of a subroutine or function using 
Procptr or @. Once initialized, you use the pointer in the same manner as calling the 
original subroutine or function. The following program illustrates declaring an using a 
function pointer.

End&nbsp;Function

Listing 8.3: funcptr.bas

Analysis: Line 4 declares the function prototype that will be used with the function 
pointer. Line 7 declares the function pointer using the the As Function syntax. Notice that 
the Dim statement does not use the Ptr keyword; the compiler knows that this will be a 
function pointer since it is declared using the As Function method. When declaring a 
function pointer, the parameter list must match the number and type of parameters of 
the pointed-to function, but as you can see, the names do not have to match. In fact, the 
pointer can be declared as Dim&nbsp;FuncPtr&nbsp;As&nbsp;Function(As&nbsp;Integer,&nbsp;As&nbsp;Integer)&nbsp;As&nbsp;
Integer, without the parameter names. The only requirement is to make sure that the 
type and number of parameters, and the return type, match the function declaration and 
definition. Line 10 initializes the function pointer to the address of the function using the 
address of operator @. You could use Procptr here as well.  Line 13 uses the pointer to 
call the function. The calling syntax is the same as using the function name: FuncPtr(2,4) 
is equivalent to Power(2, 4). Lines 15 and 16 close the program in the usual way. Lines 19 
through 21 define the actual Power function. 

Running the program will produce the following result.

2&nbsp;raised&nbsp;to&nbsp;the&nbsp;power&nbsp;of&nbsp;4&nbsp;is&nbsp;16
Listing 8.4: Output of funcptr.bas

While this example program may not seem to have any advantages over just 
calling the function directly, you can use this method to call several functions using a 
single function pointer. For example, if you were creating your own user interface, you 
could implement events using a function pointer that called one of several different 
subroutines depending on the object receiving the event. The only requirement would be 
that each subroutine must contain the same number and type of parameters.
Creating a Callback Function
One of the primary uses for function pointers is to create callback functions. A 
callback function is a function that you have created in your program that is called by a 
function or subroutine in an external library. Windows uses callback functions to 
enumerate through Window objects like fonts, printers and forms. The qsort, function 
contained within the C Runtime Library sorts the elements of an array using a callback 
function to determine the sort order. The prototype for the qsort function is contained in 
stdlib.bi:
declare&nbsp;sub&nbsp;qsort&nbsp;cdecl&nbsp;alias&nbsp;"qsort"&nbsp;(byval&nbsp;as&nbsp;any&nbsp;ptr,&nbsp;byval&nbsp;as&nbsp;size_t,&nbsp;
byval&nbsp;as&nbsp;size_t,&nbsp;byval&nbsp;as&nbsp;function&nbsp;cdecl(byval&nbsp;as&nbsp;any&nbsp;ptr,&nbsp;byval&nbsp;as&nbsp;any&nbsp;
ptr)&nbsp;as&nbsp;integer)
The following lists the parameter information for the qsort subroutine.
1. The first parameter is the address to the first element of the array. The easiest way 
to pass this information to qsort is to append the address of operator to the first 
element index: @myArray(0). 
2. The second parameter is the number of elements in the array, that is the array 
count.
3. The third parameter is the size of each element in bytes. For an array of integers, 
the element size would be 4 bytes.
4. The fourth parameter is a function pointer to the user created compare function. 
The function must be declared using the Cdecl passing model, as shown in this 
parameter. 
Using this information, you can see how qsort works. By passing the address of the 
first element along with the count of elements, and the size of each element, qsort can 
iterate through the array using pointer arithmetic. Qsort will take two array elements, 
pass them to your user defined compare function and use the compare function's return 
value to sort the array elements. It does this repeatedly until each array element is in 
sorted order. The following program uses the qsort subroutine and a compare function to 
sort an array of integers.

Listing 8.5: qsort.bas

Analysis: Line 3 includes the crt.bi file so that the qsort routine will be available in 
the program. You need to include this file if you want to use any of the CRT functions. 
Line 7 declares the compare function. You will notice that it is declared as a  Cdecl 
function, which matches the 4th parameter definition in the qsort declaration. Since qsort 
expects to see either a -1, 0 or 1, the function's return type is an integer. The undercores 
character _ at the end of line 7 is the line continuation character and tells the compiler 
that the following line is actually a part of this line. In line 11 an array of integers is 
dimensioned. The array will have 10 elements, with indexes from 0 to 9. Line 12 
dimensions a working variable i, that will be used to load and display the array values.
Line 15 seeds the random number generator by using the value from the Timer 
function. The Timer function returns the number of seconds, as a double-type value, 
since the computer was started. Lines 19 through 25 initializes the array with some 
random integers and displays them to the console screen. The code in line 22, Int(Rnd * 
20), uses the Rnd function which returns a double precision number between 0 and 1. 
That number is multiplied by twenty to produce a double-precision number between 0 
and 20 which is then converted to an integer value using the Int function. Since Int 
returns the largest integer less than or equal to the input, the resulting random numbers 
will range from 0 to 19. In line 24 the value of the current array index is printed to the 
console screen.
In line 29 the qsort subroutine is called. Since the array indexes range from 0 to 9, 
the address of operator on the zero index in used for the first parameter. The array size is 
10, so that is used as the second parameter. The array is an integer array, so 
Sizeof(Integer) is used to pass the array element size. The final parameter is the address 
of the compare function which is passed to qsort using the address of operator. Lines 34 
through 37 print out the now sorted array. Lines 39 and 40 close the program in the usual 
way.
Lines 47 through 66 contain the compare function code. In line 47 the function is 
defined just like the declare statement in line 7 using two Any Ptr parameters and 
returning an integer. The Any Ptrs allow qsort to be able to sort any type of data, 
including composite types. Lines 49 and 50 delcare the function's working variables. 
Qsort will pass pointers to the functions, not the actual data, so two integers need to be 
declared so that the data that the pointers point to can be compared. The variable cnt is 
defined as Static so that its value will be preserved between calls to the function. Cnt is 
used to keep track of how many calls to the function qsort will make as it sorts the array.

88


Lines 55 and 56 use the indirection operator to return the data from the passed 
pointers. Notice the Cptr is used to convert the Any Ptr parameters to Integer Ptrs before 
using the indirection operator. Remember that the code inside the parenthesis will be 
executed before applying the indirection operator. Line 57 prints out the current call 
count and the passed parameter values.
Line 59 through 65 compare the two values and return the appropriate indicator 
value back to qsort. The Return statement, as expected, is used to set the function's 
return value. The function is closed using the End Function keywords in line 66.

When you run the program you should something similar to the following.

Output 8.3: Output of qsort.bas

The first group of numbers show the unsorted array. The middle group of numbers 
show the number of times the compare function is called along with the values being 
sorted. The last group of numbers show the sorted array. Even though qsort is called 
quite a number of times even on this small array, the routine is extremely fast since it 
uses pointers to sort the values in the array.
Pointer to Pointer
In FreeBasic you can create a pointer to any of the supported data types, including 
the pointer data type. A pointer to a pointer is useful in situations where you need to 
return a pointer to a function or in creating specialized data structures such as linked-lists 
and ragged arrays. A pointer to a pointer is called multi-level indirection.

Caution You can have as many levels of indirection as needed, but anything 
beyond two levels is rarely useful and difficult to manage.

90


One application of a pointer to pointer is the creation of memory arrays. The 
following program demonstrates the creation, manipulation and freeing of a memory 
array.

Listing 8.6: memarray.bas

Analysis: Line 4 dimensions a pointer to an integer pointer, myMemArray, which 
will simulate a two dimensional array, with myMemArray pointing to a list of integer 
     91


pointers. This list of pointers will comprise the “rows” of the array. Line 5 just declares 
some working variables that are used in the For-Next loops later in the program.
 Line 8 creates the rows of the array by allocating a memory segment that will 
contain 4 integer pointers, which are initialized in lines 11 through 13. Remember that 
the index method of accessing a pointer automatically does the pointer arithmetic for 
you. The code in lines 11 through 13 iterates through the memory segment created in 
line 8 and initializes the memory segment with pointers to memory segments that will 
contain integers. In other words, you have a pointer that is pointing to a list of pointers. 
These newly created memory segments are the columns for each row. Each column index 
will be a pointer to a memory location containing an integer.
Lines 16 through 20 add some random numbers to the memory array. Notice that 
by using the indexing method you can access the memory array just like a normal array. i 
points to the row (the list of pointers) and j points to the individual columns within that 
row which contain the integer data. The same method is used in lines 23 through 27 to 
print out the array values.
Lines 30 through 32 free the individual rows of memory that were created in line 8. It is 
important that each row be freed before freeing myMemArray. If you were to just free 
myMemArray, the rows would still be in memory, but unaccessible, causing a memory 
leak. Once all the rows have been freed, myMemArray can be freed in line 34. Since the 
program is terminating, Deallocating the memory is not strictly required in this instance, 
but if you needed to reuse the memory,  then you must Deallocate in the method 
described, otherwise you will get a memory leak while the program is running. Lines 36 
and 37 close the program in the usual way.

Running the program should produce a result similar to the following.

Output 8.4: Output of memarray.bas

As you can see from the output, the memory array behaves exactly like a 
predefined array. This structure is useful for adding dynamic arrays to type definitions, 
which normally cannot hold a dynamic array. You will see this in more detail in the 
chapter on composite types.
One last note on this program. If you run the program more than once, you will 
notice that the values in the array are always the same, even though the program is 
generating random numbers. This is because the program did not seed the random 
number generator using the Randomize statement. To get different numbers for each run, 
add Randomize&nbsp;Timer&nbsp;before calling the Rnd function.
A Look Ahead
Pointers are an efficient and powerful data type, and you will be seeing more of 
them in this book, including the next chapter where you will explore the string data types 
available in FreeBasic.

9 String Data Types
Strings are an essential part of programming, and proper manipulation of  strings 
is an essential skill for any programmer. You will need to use strings in virtually every 
program you will write, from games to data entry programs. Strings are important 
because humans use strings to communicate concepts and ideas. A menu in a game 
communicates the various game options to the user. An address stored in a database 
communicates the location of the person who lives at that address. Programs are 
solutions to problems, and in most cases, must communicate that solution to the user 
through the use of strings.
Computers however, only understand numbers.  The string “¡FreeBasic está 
fresco!“ has no meaning to the computer. For the very first computers this did not matter 
much, since those early computers were just glorified calculators, albeit calculators that 
took up a whole room. However it soon became evident to computer engineers that in 
order for the computer to be a useful tool, it needed to be able to somehow recognize 
string data, and be able to manipulate that string data.
Since computers only understand numbers, the solution was to convert alpha-
numeric characters to numbers via translation tables. The familiar ASCII code table is one 
such translation scheme that takes a set of alpha-numeric characters and converts them 
to numbers. The “A” character is encoded as decimal 65, the exclamation point as 
decimal 33 and the number 1 is encoded as decimal 49. When you press any key on your 
keyboard, a scancode for that key is generated and stored in the computer as a number.
Humans group letters together to form words, and words to form sentences. A 
certain arrangement of letters and words mean something according to the semantic 
rules the writer's language. When you read the string “FreeBasic is cool!” you understand 
the meaning of the words if you can read the English language. The computer however 
doesn't know what FreeBasic is and doesn't know what it means to be cool. When you 
read that something is “cool” you know that this is slang for great or excellent. All the 
computer can do is store the string in memory in a way that preserves the format of the 
string so that a human reading the string will understand its meaning.

While computers have grown in both speed and capacity, the basic computing 
processes haven't changed since the 1950's. The next revolution in computing won't be 
quantum processors or holographic memory; it will be when computers can understand 
language.

The solution to the storage problem was to simply store string data in memory as a 
sequence of bytes, and terminate that sequence of bytes with a character 0. To put it 
another way, a string in computer memory is an array of characters, terminated with a 
character 0 to signal the end of the string. Virtually all early programming languages, and 
many modern ones, have no native String data type. A string in C is a Null (character 0) 
terminated array of Char, where Char can be interpreted as both a character and number. 
While this scheme accurately reflects the internal structure of a string in memory, it is 
hard to work with and error prone, and doesn't reflect the way humans work with string 
data. A better solution to the problem was the creation of the native String data type. The 
internal structure of a string has not changed, it is still stored in memory as a sequence 

94


of bytes terminated by a Null character, but the programmer can interact with string data 
in a more natural, humanistic way.
FreeBasic has four intrinsic string data types, listed in the following table.

String Type Declaration Purpose
Dynamic String Dim myString as String 8-bit string that is 
dynamically allocated and 
automatically resized.
Fixed Length String Dim myString as String * 
length

8-bit, fixed-length string.

Zstring Dim myString as Zstring * 
length
Dim myString as Zstring Ptr

8-bit, fixed-length, Null 
terminated character string. 
A Zstring is a C-style string.

Wstring Dim myString as Wstring * 
length
Dim myString as Wstring Ptr

16-bit, fixed-length, Null 
terminated string used with 
Unicode functions.

Table 9.1: Intrinsic FreeBasic String Data Types

All FreeBasic strings can hold up to 2 GB of data, or up to the amount of memory 
on your computer.
Dynamic Strings
Dynamic strings are variable-length strings that the compiler automatically 
allocates and resizes as needed. Dynamic strings are actually structures stored in 
memory, called a string descriptor, that contain a pointer to the string data, the length of 
the string data and the size of the string allocation. Dynamic strings are allocated in 36 
byte blocks, which reduces the amount of resizing that the compiler must do if the string 
size changes. The following program displays the internal string structure data for a 
typical dynamic string3.

Listing 9.1: dynastring.bas

Analysis: Lines 4 through 8 defines the string descriptor data type. The strdata 
field is a pointer to a NULL terminated string in memory. The length fields contains the 
number of characters in the string. The size field indicates the length of the current 
memory-block allocation. Line 11 creates a dynamic string and initializes the value of the 
string. Line 13 creates a pointer, StringData, that points to the string descriptor of 
myString. Notice that the address of operator is used to return the address of the string 
descriptor, which is then cast as a StringDesc Ptr using the Cptr function.
Lines 16 through 18 then print out the string descriptor data. The member 
operator, -&gt;, is used with type definition pointers and is comparable to using *PtrName. 
The member operator will be discussed in the chapter on composite types. The program 
is closed in the usual way.

Running the program in FBIde will produce the following result.

Data:&nbsp;This&nbsp;is&nbsp;a&nbsp;dynamic&nbsp;string&nbsp;in&nbsp;FreeBasic!
Length:&nbsp;&nbsp;38
Size:&nbsp;&nbsp;72
Output 9.1: Output of dynastring.bas

Dynamic strings use Zstrings strings internally so that you can pass a dynamic 
string to a function that expects a Null terminated string and the function will work 
correctly. The Windows api, the C runtime library and most third-party libraries written in 
C expect a Null terminated string as a string parameter.

Caution In other versions of Basic, strings have been used to load and manipulate 
binary data. If the binary data contains a Null character, this could cause problems with 
FreeBasic strings, since the Null character is used to terminate a string. While it is 
possible to have an embedded Null in a dynamic string (since dynamic strings have a 
string descriptor), if you pass this data to a third party library function that is expecting a 
C-style string, the data will read only up to the Null character, resulting in data loss. 
Instead of using strings to read binary data, you should byte arrays instead.

96


Since a dynamic string is actually a pointer to a string descriptor, you cannot use 
dynamic strings in type definitions that you are going to save to a file. You should use a 
fixed length string instead.
Fixed Length Strings
Fixed length strings are defined using a length parameter, and can only hold 
strings that are less than or equal to the defined size. Trying to initialize a fixed length 
string with data that is longer than the defined size will result in the string being 
truncated to fit.
The following short program illustrates creating and using a fixed length string.

Listing 9.2: fixedstr.bas

Analysis: Lines 4 defines a fixed length string that can hold up to 20 characters. 
Line 7 loads the variable with a string and line 8 prints the contents of the variable. Since 
the string "This should fit." is smaller than 20 characters, so the whole string will be 
printed out. Line 11 tries to initialize the string with data that is longer than 20 characters 
so the string will be truncated when it is printed out in line 12.

When you run the program you should see the following output.

This&nbsp;should&nbsp;fit.
This&nbsp;string&nbsp;will&nbsp;be
Output 9.2: Output of fixedstr.bas

     97


As you can see from the output, if a string is too long to fit in the variable, it will be 
truncated to fit. Fixed length strings are very useful when creating random access records 
using type definitions. This technique is used in the chapter on file handling.
Zstrings
Zstrings are Null terminated, C-style strings. The main purpose of a Zstring is to 
interface with third-party libraries that expect a C-style strings, however they are useful 
even if you do not plan to pass them to third-party libraries. Zstrings can be defined just 
like a fixed-length string, Dim&nbsp;myZstring&nbsp;as&nbsp;Zstring&nbsp;*&nbsp;10, and FreeBasic will handle 
them just like fixed strings, automatically truncating data to fit the defined size. 
Unlike fixed strings however, Zstrings can be dynamically managed by declaring a 
Zstring pointer and using the associated memory functions. When using a dynamically 
allocated Zstring, you must be careful not to overwrite the the size of the string, as this 
will overwrite parts of memory not contained in the string and may cause the program or 
even the operating system to crash.
When using either type of Zstring, FreeBasic will manage the terminating Null 
character for you, but the storage size of a Zstring will be 1 less than the defined size 
since the the Null character occupies the last character position. When calculating the 
size of a Zstring be sure to add 1 to the value to account for the Null terminator. You must 
also not include the character 0 in any of your data, or the data will be truncated since 
FreeBasic will see the Null character as the end of the string.
The following program shows both uses of the Zstring data type.

Listing 9.3: zstring.bas

Analysis: Line 4 declares a fixed length Zstring. Notice that the desired data length 
is 20 so 1 is added to to allocate space for the terminating Null character. Line 6 declares 
a pointer to a Zstring that will be managed dynamically. Line 9 prints out a ruler to 
compare the print statements in line 11 and 13. Line 10 initializes the Zstring with some 
data that is small enough to fit in the declared size. Line 12 adds some data that is too 
long to fit within the Zstring, which will be truncated to fit. 
Line 16 prints another ruler for comparison with the dynamic Zstring data. Line 17 
Callocates enough space for a 20-byte string along with the terminating Null character. 
Since myDynaZstring is defined as a Zstring Ptr, the indirection operator is used to 
initialize the variable data in line 18. Line 22 resizes the Zstring to hold 5 additional 
characters plus the terminating Null using the Reallocate function. Another ruler is 
printed in line 23 to show the new size of the data loaded into the variable in line 24. Line 
25 uses the pointer index method to print out the contents of the variable. Line 28 
deallocates the allocated memory.

When you run this program you should get the following output.

123456789012345678901

Output 9.3: Output of zstring.bas

As you can see, the fixed length version of the Zstring data type behaves exactly 
like the fixed string data type and the dynamic version behaves exactly like any other 
pointer-based memory segment. Since there is no intrinsic method for determining the 
size of a Zstring allocation, you must be careful not to over-run the buffer. The best way 
to do this is to keep a current allocation size in a separate variable that can be referenced 
as needed.
You will notice in Line 25 of the listing that the pointer index method was used to 
print the contents of the resized Zstring. What would the output be if you changed the

index from 0 to 6? Remember that a pointer index behaves much like an array index, and 
a Zstring could be viewed as an array of characters. If you were to use 6 as the index, the 
output would be add&nbsp;some&nbsp;more&nbsp;data. The Print statement would start at character 
position 6 and print everything up to the terminating Null character. 
You can directly assign a fixed length Zstring to a dynamic string. For a dynamic 
Zstring, the pointer must be dereferenced by using * or the pointer index method. Keep 
in mind that the behavior of the indexing method is the same for assignments as it is for 
the Print statement.
Wstrings
Dynamic, fixed and Zstrings all use 1 byte per character. Wstrings, also called wide 
strings, use 2 bytes per character and is generally used in conjunction with Unicode 
strings functions. Unicode is, strictly speaking, a character coding scheme designed to 
associate a number for every character of every language used in the world today, as 
well as some ancient languages that are of historical interest. In the context of 
developing an application, Unicode is used to internationalize a program so that the end-
user can view the program in their native language.
Wstrings can be both fixed length and dynamic and are similar to Zstrings. 
Wstrings will be discussed in more detail in the chapter on Unicode.
String Functions
Creating and using strings in your application will often consist of manipulating 
those strings and FreeBasic has a rich set of string functions, which are listed in the 
following table.

Len Versus Sizeof
For numeric data types, Len and Sizeof both return the size of the data type. For 
string data types, Len returns the length of the string data and Sizeof returns the data

Listing 9.4: strtype.bas

Analysis: Lines 4 through 7 dimension a string of each type.  Lines 10 through 13 
initialize the string variables with some string data. Lines 15 through 18 print out the 
string data for reference.  Lines 22 through 25 use the Len function to print out the length 
of the actual string data. Lines 29 through 32 use the Sizeof function to print out the 
length of the data types. The program is closed in the usual manner.

Running the program should produce the following output.

Dynamic&nbsp;string:&nbsp;Hello&nbsp;World&nbsp;From&nbsp;FreeBasic!
Fixed&nbsp;string:&nbsp;Hello&nbsp;World!

Output 9.4: Output of stringtype.bas

As you can see from the output, Len and Sizeof return different values. The Len 
function automatically dereferences the string variables and returns the length of the 
actual string, while the Sizeof function returns the length of the string variable itself. For a 
dynamic string, Sizeof returns the length of the string descriptor. The string descriptor 
contains a pointer to a Zstring (4 bytes), an integer containing the length of the string (4 
bytes) and an integer that contains the size of the current allocation (4 bytes) which total 
to 12 bytes. For fixed length string and for Zstrings, Sizeof returns the dimensioned size 
of the variable. For a Wstring, the size is twice the dimensioned value because a Wstring 
uses 16-bit characters rather than 8-bit characters. The Sizeof function is useful for 
determining the allocation size of fixed length strings, fixed allocation Zstrings and fixed 
allocation Wstrings so that you do not inadvertently lose data by trying to initialize the 
variable with more data than it can hold. Dynamic strings can contain variable length 
data so Sizeof is rarely used with dynamic strings.
Using String Functions with Zstring Pointers
There will be times when you will need to use a string function with a Zstring 
pointer. If you try to use the pointer with directly with a string function you will receive a 
Type Mismatch error from the compiler. What you need to do is to dereference the pointer 
when passing the Zstring to a string function so that the function can access the string 
data directly. The following program illustrates this concept.

End
Listing 9.5: zstringfunc.bas

Analysis: Line 3 dimensions a Zstring pointer, myZstring. Line 5 allocates some 
space for the string data in line 6. Line 8 uses the Instr function to determine the position 
104


of the F character in the string and prints the position to the screen. Notice that the 
dereference operator is used inside the function with myZstring so that Instr has access 
to the string data. Line 10 deallocates the memory assigned to the variable. The program 
is then closed in the usual way.

When you run the program you should see the following output.

F&nbsp;is&nbsp;at&nbsp;position&nbsp;7
Output 9.5: Output of zstringfunc.bas

This technique only applies to a Zstring pointer. A fixed length Zstring can be 
passed directly to the string functions with no need to dereference the variable.
The MK* and CV* String Functions
There are times when you will want to save numeric data to a disk file, such as 
when you are creating your  own database system. Saving numeric data as strings can 
be problematic since the string representation of the data can vary. Once solution to this 
problem is to use the various MK* functions which convert the binary representation of a 
number into a string, and CV* functions which convert the string back into a number. The 
advantage of using these functions is consistent numeric representation; an integer is 
converted into a 4-byte string, a double is converted into an 8-byte string. This makes 
saving and reading binary data from the disk quite easy. The following table lists the MK* 
and CV* functions.

Function Syntax Comment
Mkd B = Mkd(number) Converts a double-type 
number to a string with 
length of 8 bytes.
Mki B = Mki(number) Converts an integer-type

Listing 9.6: mkcv.bas

Analysis: Line 4 creates three integer-type variables, myInt which will contain the 
initial integer value, myIntC which will contain the numeric value after the Cvi conversion 
and i which is a variable that will be used in the following For loop. Line 5 create two 
double-type variables, myDbl which will contain the initial double value and myDblC 
which will contain the Cvd conversion value. Line 7 creates two string variables, mySInt 
and mySDbl which will contain the Mki and Mkd string conversion values respectively. 
Lines 10 and 11 set the initial values of the variables and lines 12 and 13 print out 
those values for reference. Lines 16 and 17 convert the integer and double values to 
binary string representations using the Mki and Mkd functions. Line 21 through 23 print 
out the ascii code values for the converted integer string. The Len function is used to 
determine the length of the string, which in the case of the integer will be four bytes. The 
ascii codes are print rather than the characters since the string is a binary representation 
of the integer value and some of the characters will not be visible on the screen. Lines 26 
through 28 print out the character values for the converted double-type value.
Lines 31 and 32 convert the string representations back into numeric values which 
are printed to the screen in lines 34 and 35.

When you run the program you should see the following output.

Integer:&nbsp;&nbsp;10
Double:&nbsp;&nbsp;254.56

Mki:&nbsp;10&nbsp;0&nbsp;0&nbsp;0
Mkd:&nbsp;82&nbsp;184&nbsp;30&nbsp;133&nbsp;235&nbsp;209&nbsp;111&nbsp;64

Cvi:&nbsp;&nbsp;10
Cvd:&nbsp;&nbsp;254.56
Output 9.6: Output of mkcv.bas

You can see from the output that the Mk* functions create an exact binary 
representation of the numeric values. Since the Mk* functions create strings that are the 
same length as their numeric counterparts, you have a very consistent representation of 
the numbers. This makes these functions quite useful when creating variable length 
records that will be stored on the disk.

If your program requires fixed-length records, you can use a Type definition to create 
disk records. This technique will be covered in the chapter on file handling.

Numeric String Conversion Functions
You find as you write programs that there are instances where you need to convert 
a text string such as “124.5” into a number, and the number 124.5 into a string. 
FreeBasic has several conversion functions that can be used to accomplish these tasks.

Function Syntax Comment
Format B = Format(number, 
format_string)

Returns a formatted 
number. You must include 
"vbcompat.bi" in your 
program to use this 
function.
Str B = Str(number) Converts a numeric 
expression to a string 
representation. That is, 145 
will become “145”.
Val B = Val(string) Converts a string to a 
double value. The Val 
functions will convert from 
left to right, ending at the 
first non-numeric character.
Valint B = Valint(string) Converts a string to an 
integer value.
Vallng B = Vallng(string) Converts a string to a long 
integer value.
Valuint B = Valuint(string) Converts a string to a 
unsigned integer value.
Valulong B = Valulong(string) Converts a string to an 
unsigned long integer value.
Table 9.4: Numeric String Functions

108


These functions work just like the Mk* and Cv* functions, except that these 
functions work with text representations of the numeric values rather than binary 
representations. A common usage of these functions is in reading text files that contain 
text numbers, such as ini files, and the text needs to be converted to a number, and then 
back to a string for output to the disk. They are also useful for getting input from the 
user, a technique you will see in the chapter on the console functions.
The Format function is a general purpose function that can format numbers, dates 
and time. A seperate chapter is devoted to using the Format function.
Wide String Functions
Since wide strings contain 16-bit characters, there are a few string functions that 
work specifically with wide strings. The functions listed in the following table behave in 
the same manner as their 8-bit counterparts.

Function Syntax Comment
Wbin B = Wbin(number)
B = Wbin(number, digits)

Returns the binary form of 
number as a wide string. 
Can optionally return only 
number of digits.

Wchr B = Wchr(unicode)
B = Wchr(unicode, unicode, 
...)

Returns the character 
represented by Unicode. If 
multiple codes are passed to 
Wchr, the function will 
return a string of unicode 
characters.

Whex B = Whex(number)
B = Whex(number, digits)

Returns the hexadecimal 
form of number as a wide 
string. Can optionally return 
only number of digits.

Woct B = Woct(number)
B = Woct(number, digits)

Returns the octal form of 
number as a wide string. 
Can optionally return only 
number of digits.
Wspace B = Wspace(number) Returns a wide string with 
number of spaces.
Wstr B = Wstr(number)
B = Wstr(ascii_string)

The first form of Wstr will 
return a wide string 
resprestation of a number. 
The second form will 
convert an ascii string to a 
Unicode string.

Wstring B = Wstring(number, code)
B = Wstring(number, string)

String will return a wide 
string with number of 
characters that correspond 
to the ascii character code 
or the first character of 
string.
     109


Table 9.5: Wide String Functions

The wide string functions work in the same manner as their regular string 
counterparts.
String Operators
There are two string operators &amp; and + which concatenate two or more strings 
together. &amp; is preferred over + since &amp; will automatically convert the operands to strings, 
where + will not. 
CRT Character and String Functions
The C Runtime Library has a number of functions to identify different characters 
and manipulate strings. These functions are useful for managing string data such as 
identifying numbers or parsing tokens within a string. While all of these actions can be 
coded using Basic code, using the CRT functions can speed development time, and in 
some cases operate much faster than equivalent Basic code.
Character Functions
In the ctype.bi declaration file, located in the inc\crt folder, you will find a number 
of functions to identify different types of characters. To use these functions in your 
program you must include the ctype.bi file, #include&nbsp;once&nbsp;"crt/ctype.bi". The 
following table lists the different character functions. All of these functions take an ascii 
character code and return a non-zero result if successful or a zero result if not successful.

Function Syntax Comment
Isalnum B = Isalnum(asc_code) Returns non-zero if the 
character is an alpha-
numeric character, zero if 
not.
Isalpha B = Isalpha(asc_code) Returns non-zero if the 
character is an alphabetical 
character, zero if not.
Iscntrl B = Iscntrl(asc_code) Returns non-zero if the 
character is a control 
character, such as a Tab, 
zero if not.
Isdigit B = Isdigit(asc_code) Returns non-zero if the 
character is a numeric digit, 
0 to 9, zero if not.
Isgraph B = Isgraph(asc_code) Returns non-zero if the 
characterhas a glyph 
associated with it, zero if 
not.  This function only 
identifies the standard glyph 
characters in the lower ascii 
range.

110


Function Syntax Comment
Islower B = Islower(asc_code) Returns non-zero if the 
character is lower-case, zero 
if not.
Isprint B = Isprint(asc_code) Returns non-zero if the 
character is a printable 
character, zero if not. This 
function only identifies the 
printable characters in the 
lower ascii range.
Ispunct B = Ispunct(asc_code) Returns non-zero if the 
character is a punctuation 
character, zero if not.
Isspace B = Isspace(asc_code) Returns non-zero if the 
character is a whitespace 
character, zero if not. 
Whitespace is defined as a 
space, form-feed, new-line, 
carriage return, horizontal 
and vertical tabs.
Isupper B = Isupper(asc_code) Returns non-zero if the 
character is upper-case, 
zero if not.
Isxdigit B = isxdigit(asc_code) Returns non-zero if the 
character is a hexidecimal 
digit, zero if not. 
Hexadecimal digits include 0 
through 9, A through F and 
a through f.

Listing 9.7: crt_char.bas

Analysis: Line 3 includes the ctype.bi file that is needed to link to these CRT 
functions. Lines 5 and 6 declare the working variables. MyString will contain the 
characters to identify, ret is the return value from the function, i is used in the For-Next 
     113


loop and ichar contains the fascicle code of the character that is passed as the parameter 
to the different functions. Line 12 through 15 display a header line that will be used to 
identify which functions returns a true result. The different column headers refer to the 
different functions. Alnum is the return column for the Isalnum function, the Alpha 
column is the return for the Isalpha function and so on.
Line 18 and 94 comprise the For-Next block. Line 19 gets the current character 
from the string and converts it to an ascii code using the Asc function. The character is 
then tested with each function. If the function returns a non-zero result, a Y is printed in 
the appropriate column. If the function returns a zero, an N is printed in the appropriate 
column.
The program is then closed in the usual way.

When you run the program you should see the following result.

Output 9.7: Output of crt_char.bas

As you can see, these functions work with the lower ascii characters, which are the 
characters you would normally find in text files. Using these functions can make your job 
a lot easier when you are trying to identify characters from a file or from user input.
Strtok Function
The Strtok function will return tokens separated by a delimiter set. Strtok is quite 
fast and since it will look for a set of delimiters, it is much easier to use Strtok than Instr 
within a loop. Strtok is contained in the string.bi declaration file located in the inc\crt 
folder of your FreeBasic installation. Strtok is declared as:

declare&nbsp;function&nbsp;strtok&nbsp;cdecl&nbsp;alias&nbsp;"strtok"&nbsp;(byval&nbsp;as&nbsp;zstring&nbsp;ptr,&nbsp;_
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;byval&nbsp;as&nbsp;zstring&nbsp;ptr)&nbsp;as&nbsp;zstring&nbsp;ptr
114


The first parameter is the string to parse and the second parameter is the delimiter 
set. Strtok returns a pointer to the first token in the string. Even though the parameters 
are defined as Zstring pointers, you can use  dynamic strings since the compiler will 
automatically dereference a dynamic string if it is passed to a Zstring pointer. This makes 
working with this function quite easy. You will need to define a Zstring pointer as the 
return value though.
The following program uses Strtok to parse a string into tokens.

Listing 9.8: strtok.bas

Analysis: Line 3 includes the crt library declarations so that Strtok is available to 
the program. Lines 5 and 6 define the working variables. Tstr is the original parse string, 
tmpstr is a copy of the original string and delim is the set of delimiters. Zret is defined as 
     115


a Zstring pointer and will be the return value from the function. Line 10 sets the delimiter 
set and line 12 sets the parse string. In line 15 a copy is made of the original string, since 
Strtok will alter the string as it is parsed. If you need to save the original string value, use 
a temporary string with the function rather than the original string. Line 17 calls Strtok 
with the parse string and the delimiter set. This initial call sets up the function to parse 
the string. Subsequent calls to Strtok will use a Null in place of the parse string to 
indicate that you want to parse the original string and not a new string.
Line 19 checks for a Null pointer. Strtok will return a Null when it cannot extract 
any tokens from the parse string. You should always check for a NULL pointer before 
using the pointer reference. Line 20 prints the value of the token using the pointer index 
method. This will print everything from index 0 up to the terminating Null character. 
Remember that Zstring are C-type strings, an array of characters that terminate with 
character zero, a Null.
Line 22 through 28 call Strtok with a Null for the parse string to extract each token 
from the string. Thre loop terminates when a Null is returned from Strtok. Once again, in 
line 25, the pointer is checked to make sure it isn't a Null pointer before the value is 
printed to the console window.
After all the tokens have been processed, zret will be Null, the loop will exit and the 
program will close in the usual manner.

When you run the program you should the following output.

Hello
World
From
Freebasic
Output 9.8: Output of strtok.bas

The output shows the individual tokens in the string. Not only is Strtok easy to use, 
but because you can pass a set of delimiters the amount of code you have to write to 
parse a string that has several delimiters is considerably less than if you wrote the parse 
function in FreeBasic. Less code means less chance of things going wrong, which results 
in a more robust, stable program.
A Look Ahead
So far in the book you have seen the individual intrinsic data types. There are 
times though when you need an aggregate data type to fully describe your data. This is 
where Type definitions and Unions come in handy, which are discussed in the next 
chapter.

116


10 Composite Data Types
There are times when creating a program that you may want to define an 
aggregate structure such as a personnel record, or an enemy in a game. While you can 
do this using individual data types, it is hard to manage within  a program. FreeBasic 
offers two composite data types, the Type and Union. 
Types
FreeBasic allows you to group several data types into a unified structure called a 
Type definition which you can use to describe these aggregate data structures.
The basic structure of a type definition is:

Type&nbsp;typename
var&nbsp;definition
var&nbsp;definition
...
End&nbsp;Type

The Type-End Type block defines the scope of the definition. You define the 
elements of the type structure in the same manner as using the Dim keyword, without 
using Dim. The following code snippet shows how to build an employee type.

Type&nbsp;EmployeeType
fname&nbsp;As&nbsp;String&nbsp;*&nbsp;10
&nbsp;lname&nbsp;As&nbsp;String&nbsp;*&nbsp;10
&nbsp;empid&nbsp;As&nbsp;Integer
&nbsp;dept&nbsp;As&nbsp;Integer
End&nbsp;Type

You can use any of the supported data types as data elements, including pointers 
and other type definitions. When you create the type definition, such as the example 
above, you are just creating a template for the compiler.    In order to use the type 
definition, you need to create a variable of the type, as the following code snippet 
illustrates.

Dim&nbsp;Employee&nbsp;As&nbsp;EmployeeType

Once you have created a variable of the type, you can access each element within 
the type using the dot notation var_name.field_name.  Using the above example, to 
access the fname field you would use Employee.fname&nbsp;=&nbsp;“Susan”.
To access multiple fields at a time, you can use the With-End With block. The 
following code snippet shows how to use the With block with the above example.

     117


With&nbsp;Employee
&nbsp;.fname&nbsp;=&nbsp;"Susan"
&nbsp;.lname&nbsp;=&nbsp;"Jones"
.empid&nbsp;=&nbsp;1001
&nbsp;.dept&nbsp;=&nbsp;24
End&nbsp;With

Listing 10.1: type.bas

Analysis: Line 4 through 9 define the type structure that is used in the program. 
The type has 4 fields, two fixed length strings and 2 integer values. Dynamic strings can 
118


be used within a type definition, however if you want to save the type information to the 
disk, then you need to use fixed length strings. Dynamic strings are actually pointers to a 
string descriptor and saving a type that contains dynamic strings will save the 4 byte 
pointer value, rather than the actual string data, resulting in data loss.
Line 12 creates a variable of the type, Employee. The type definition is a template 
and cannot be used until you create an instance of the type by creating a variable of the 
type. Lines 15 through 20 initialize the type variable with some data using the a With-End 
With block.
Line 23 prints a header row to the console that indicates the field name data. The 
Tb function is used to align data names to the appropriate column. Line 24 uses the 
String function to print a dashed line, just to offset the header row from the data row. 
Lines 26 through 28 prints the type data. Rtrim is used on the fixed length string 
elements to trim off any unused trailing spaces. The Tab function is again used to align 
the data to the appropriate columns. The program is then ended in the usual way.

When you run the program you should the following output.

First&nbsp;Name&nbsp;&nbsp;Last&nbsp;Name&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Emp&nbsp;ID&nbsp;&nbsp;Dept
­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­
Susan&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Jones&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1001&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;24
Output 10.1: Output of type.bas

As you can see from the program, using a type definition is a perfect way to group 
related data into a single data structure. Not only is it a compact way to describe data in 
your program, but by grouping related data into a single object, you can manipulate that 
data as a single entity, rather than as a bunch of unrelated variables. This reduces the 
chances that errors will creep into your program by trying to manage large a set of 
individual variables.
Types Within Types
In addition to the intrinsic data types, type fields can also be based on a type 
definition. Why would you want to do this? One reason is data abstraction. The more 
general your data structures, the more you can reuse the code in other parts of your 
program. The less code you have to write, the less chance of errors finding their way into 
your program. Using the Employee example, suppose for a moment that you needed to 
track more dept information than just the department id. You might need to keep track of 
the department manager, the location of the department, such as the floor or the 
building, or the main telephone number of the department. By putting this information 
into a separate type definition, you could this information by itself, or as part of another 
type definition such as the Employee type. By generalizing your data structures, your 
program will be smaller, and much more robust.
Using a type within a type is the same as using on of the intrinsic data types. The 
following code snippets illustrates an expanded department type and an updated 
employee type.

Type&nbsp;DepartmentType

     119


id&nbsp;As&nbsp;integer
&nbsp;managerid&nbsp;as&nbsp;integer
&nbsp;floor&nbsp;as&nbsp;integer
End&nbsp;Type

Type&nbsp;EmployeeType
fname&nbsp;As&nbsp;String&nbsp;*&nbsp;10
&nbsp;lname&nbsp;As&nbsp;String&nbsp;*&nbsp;10
&nbsp;empid&nbsp;As&nbsp;Integer
&nbsp;dept&nbsp;As&nbsp;DepartmentType
End&nbsp;Type
Dim&nbsp;Employee&nbsp;As&nbsp;EmployeeType

To access the department information within the Employee type, you use the 
compound dot notation to access the dept fields.

Employee.dept.id&nbsp;=&nbsp;24
Employee.dept.managerid&nbsp;=&nbsp;1012
Employee.dept.floor&nbsp;=&nbsp;13

The top levels is Employee, so that reference comes first. Since dept is now a type 
definition, you need to use the dept  identifier to access the individual fields within the 
DepartmentType. You can even carry this further, by including a type within a type within 
a type. You would simply use the dot notation of the additional type level as needed. 
While there is no limit on the levels of nested type definitions, it gets to be a bit unwieldy 
when used with several levels.
You can also use the With-End With block with nested types, by nesting the With 
block, as illustrated in the following code snippet.

With&nbsp;Employee
&nbsp;.fname&nbsp;=&nbsp;"Susan"
&nbsp;.lname&nbsp;=&nbsp;"Jones"
&nbsp;.empid&nbsp;=&nbsp;1001
&nbsp;With&nbsp;.dept
&nbsp;.id&nbsp;=&nbsp;24
&nbsp;.managerid&nbsp;=&nbsp;1012
&nbsp;.floor&nbsp;=&nbsp;13
&nbsp;End&nbsp;With
End&nbsp;With

Notice that the second With uses the dot notation, .dept, to specify the next level 
of type definitions. When using nested With blocks, be sure that match all the End With 
statements with their correct With statements to avoid a compile error.
The following program is a modified version of the previous program illustrating 
the new type definitions.

Listing 10.2: type-type.bas

Analysis: Lines 4 through 8 define the new type for the department. This is used in 
the employee type definition is line 14. The field dept is defined as DepartmentType, in 
the same manner as Employee is defined in line 18, with the Dim of course. Line 21 
through 30 use two With-End With blocks to initialize the type data. Employee is the first 
level type, while .dept, using the dot notation, is the second level type. It is important 
that you use the dot notation with the second level With block so that the compiler knows 
that you are referring to a type element within Employee. Lines 33 and 34 prints the 
header row with the additional department field information. Lines 37 through 42 then 
print the type data, again using a nested With block. Notice how using the With blocks 
document the type structure without needing any additional comments. While this isn't 
the primary reason to use a With block, it does create code that is easily understood. The 
program is closed in the usual way.

When you run the program you should see the following output.

First&nbsp;Name&nbsp;&nbsp;Last&nbsp;Name&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Emp&nbsp;ID&nbsp;&nbsp;Dept&nbsp;&nbsp;Manager&nbsp;Floor
­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­

Output 10.2: Output of type-type.bas

While it may not be readily apparent from the example, abstracting the data in this 
manner gives you a tremendous amount of flexibility in your program. A company will 
usually have more than one department, so by abstracting the department information 
into a separate type definition, you can create functions that manage the department 
information, while at the same time minimizing the impact on the employee data 
structure.
Type Assignments
Extending the idea of data abstraction further, it would be nice to be able to 
separate the initialization of the department type from the initialization of the employee 
type. By separating the two functions, you can easily add additional departments as 
needed. This is where you can use type assignments. Just as you can assign one intrinsic 
data type to another, you can assign one type variable to another type variable, 
providing they share the same type definition.
The following program abstracts the department initialization function and assigns 
the result to the department type within the Employee type.

Listing 10.3: type-assign.bas

Analysis: This program is identical to the previous program, with the addition of the 
department initialization function in lines 18 through 43. The functions is defined in line 
18 as returning the DepartmentType, with one parameter, the department id. Line 19 
creates a temporary department type variable that will be initialized with the appropriate 
data, and returned from the function. The function uses a Select Case block to set the 
data within the temporary type. The Select statement will execute the block of code that 
matches the deptid. If no matches are found, the Else case will return a zero for each 
element. Since it is probable that no dept will have an id of 0, this value can be checked 
to make sure that the passed deptid is valid. The Return statement in line 42 returns the 
initialized dept information to the caller.
The function is used in line 53 to set the data values for the department in the 
Employee type. Although this program doesn't include a check for an invalid department 
id for clarity, you could add a check on the department id following the Employee 
initialization code to make sure that a valid department id was used in the function.
The rest of the program is the same as the previous program, and prints the 
employee information to the screen.

When you run the program, you should see that the output is identical to the 
previous program output.

By just adding a simple function to the program, you have made the program 
easier to maintain than the previous versions. If a new department is created, you can 
simply update the InitDept function with the new department information, recompile and 
the program is ready to go.
Pointers to Types
You can create a pointer to a type, just as you can create a pointer to any of the 
intrinsic data types, and the same rules apply. As with any pointer, you must allocate 
some memory for the pointer, dereference the data elements, and deallocate the pointer 
when you are done using it. Type pointers use the arrow notation, -&gt;, rather than the dot 
notation to access the individual fields with a type.
In the previous program listing, the error checking on an invalid department id was 
clunky at best. A better method is to have the InitDept function return a success code 
that indicates a valid department id. The following program implements this strategy, 
and uses a DepartmentType pointer to hold the department information for the Employee 
type.

Listing 10.4: type-ptr.bas

Analysis: This version of the program has a few modifications from the previous 
versions, but overall it is the same program. Line 3 defines a return for the InitDept 
function. If the functions returns this code, the department id is valid; if the function does 
not return this code, the department id is invalid. The type definitions are the same as 
used previously, but the function in line 20 has changed.
The function now returns an integer value, and there are two parameters, a 
department id and a pointer to the DepartmentType. Line 21 dimensions and initializes 
the function return value to deptok. If there are not errors, this value will be returned. If 
the deptid is invalid, the Case Else will set the return value to Not deptok (-1) in line 36. 
This is a good technique to return boolean values from a function. By initializing the 
return variable to the “ok” status, you only need to set the variable to the “not ok” status, 
if an error occurs. Less typing, less code and fewer chances of introducing bugs into the 
program.
In the individual Case blocks, the arrow notation is used to access the individual 
fields of the type pointer. The -&gt; automatically dereferences the pointer for you, making 
it easier to manipulate the individual fields within the type. Line 39 returns the success 
code of the function. You don't need to return any type information, because the function 
is actually updating the external department type variable through the pointer.
Line 44 dimensions a DepartmentType pointer. Which is initialized in line 47. 
Remember that Callocate allocates a memory segment, clears the segment and then 
returns the address of the segment which is stored in the variable tmpDept. In line 49 the 
InitDept function is called inside an If statement. If the function fails, that is returns Not 
deptok, then the program deallocates the pointer and prints an error message. If the 
function succeeds, that is returns deptok, then the Employee type is initialized and the 
data is printed to the screen. Notice in line 59 that the program is still using a type 
assignment, but because tmpDept is a pointer, the dereference operator must be used. 
Line 62 shows the power of using pointers as intermediate data structures. Once 
the department data is in the Employee type, you don't need the department type 
reference. Line 62 deallocates tmpDept, freeing the memory it was using. There is no 
sense in wasting memory on data structures that you only use for a very short time.
The rest of the program is identical to the previous programs.

When you run this program you should again see the same output as the previous 
programs.

Output 10.4: Output of type-ptr.bas

This change, like the previous change, was minor—most of the original program is 
in intact—but the program is now much more robust, easier to manage, and less prone to 
error than the original program. The fact that the output has not changed even though 
the program has, is a good indicator that the changes that were made were did not 
create unwanted side effects in the program. This is what data abstraction does; 
minimize negative impacts on existing code.
Type Memory Arrays
In the chapter on pointers, you saw how to create a memory array of integers 
using pointers. You can do the same with Type definitions, in much the same way. The

Listing 10.5: memtype.bas

Analysis: Lines 4 through 6 declare a simple type. Line 9 dimensions a pointer to 
myType, and line 10 creates an integer variable i for the following For-Next loops. Line 13 
allocates memory for 5 myType entries in the memory array. Lines 16 through 19 
initialize the individual type elements. Notice the syntax is 
type_variable[index].field_name. Since myTypePtr is a typed pointer, you can use the 
index method to access each element in the array. You then use the dot notation to 
access each individual field of the type, just as you would using a single type variable. 
Lines 21 through 25 print the data to the screen using the same pointer index method.
Line 28 resizes the memory array with an additional 5 type elements. Lines 31 
through 33 initialize the new memory segment with data, and lines 26 through 39 print 
the all the data to the screen. Line 42 deallocates the memory and the program is closed 
in the usual way.

When you run the program you should the following output.

As you can see, creating a memory array of types is very straight forward. You 
create the number of elements you need by using Callocate and then using the index 
pointer method, you can access each individual type field using the dot notation. The 
advantage of using this method is that you can create dynamic structures in memory and 
grow or shrink them as necessary so that you are not wasting memory on elements you 
may not need. You can of course create a standard array of types, which will be covered 
in the chapter on arrays, and you can even create a dynamic array of types—but the 
method shown here does not incur the overhead of a dynamic array, and can be passed 
to functions using the pointer method.
Dynamic Arrays in Types
FreeBasic does allow you you to create an array within a type, which is covered in 
the chapter on arrays, but it does not allow you to create dynamic arrays in types. There 
are times when you will need to create a dynamic structure in a type, and this can be 
accomplished by using memory array method within a type. The following program 
illustrates a dynamic array of a type within a type.

Listing 10.6: dynatype.bas

Analysis: Lines 4 through 7 define a type that will be used in the dynamic array. 
The program will use the row and column to print a character to the screen. Lines 11 
through 13 define the base type. Notice that darray is dimensioned as a pointer to the 
type pt. If you needed an array of integers, you would use As Integer Ptr. The methods 
are the same whether using an intrinsic data type, or another type as illustrated here. 
Line 20 allocates memory for 5 array elements. Since the program is creating an array of 
types, the second parameter to Callocate is the size of the type, pt. For an integer array it 
would be Sizeof(Integer). Lines 23 through 26 initialize the type array with a random 
row and column which will be used within the print code that follows. The access syntax 
in lines 24 and 25 follow what you have already seen; the dot notation is used to access 
the base type field darray, which is then accessed using the pointer indexing method, 
since the program is using a typed pointer. The dot notation is then used to access the 
individual fields of the array type. The syntax is the same as that shown with the type 
memory array, except here you have one additional level of indirection because the array 
is contained within a type.
Lines 29 through 32 use the row and column fields to print an X to the screen. 
Again you can see that the dot notation and pointer index methods are used to access 
the fields within the type. Line 35 frees the memory allocated and the program is closed 
in the usual way.

     131


When you run the program you should see something similar to the following 

output.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;X
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;X

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;X

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;X

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;X
Output 10.6: Output of dynatype.bas

The location of the X's will vary since the rows and columns are generated 
randomly, but since Randomize is not being used, you should the same layout between 
runs.
The two previous programs are quite similar in format. The differences are the 
levels of indirection being used. In the memory array program, the type itself was being 
used as the array element, so the pointer index was used at the top level, with the dot 
notation used to access the field data. In this program, the memory array is embedded 
within the type, so you use the standard dot notation to access the base type field, 
darray, and then use the pointer index method on the field to select the array element. 
Since the array element is a type, you use the dot notation to access the array element 
field, just as you would as if it were a simple type variable.
You could of course create a memory array that contained a memory array. In this 
case, you would use the pointer index method to select the base type element, and then 
the dot notation to select the memory array field, then a pointer index to access the 
element within the embedded array, and finally the dot notation to select the array 
element field. It sounds complicated, but is actually easier to implement than it is to 
explain. The following program modifies the previous program to illustrate this concept.

Listing 10.7: dyna-type2.bas

Analysis: Line 4 through 7 define the type that that will be an array within the base 
type. Lines 11 through 13 define the base type. Darray is dimensioned as a pointer to the 
     133


type pt since this will be a memory array with the base type. Line 16 defines a pointer to 
the base type, Dtype, since the base type will also be a memory array. Line 17 defines 
two working variables, i and j, which will be used in the For-Next loops to create and load 
data within the types. Line 20 initializes the random number generator. 
Line 23 creates a three-element memory using the base type. Lines 25 through 27 
then create a three-element memory array using the subtype, pt, for each base type 
element. Notice that the base type, myType is indexed using the pointer index method 
since it is a pointer, and each darray element is initialized using Callocate, since darray is 
also a pointer. Lines 30 through 35 load data into the memory array elements row and 
column. The outer For loop indexes the base type pointer, while the inner loop indexes 
the darray type pointer. Since darray is an element of myType, darray is selected using 
the dot notation, and since row and col are elements of daray, these are selected using 
the dot notation.
Lines 38 through 43 use the same logic to print the X's on the screen. The outer 
loop selects the base type pointer, while the inner loop selects the embedded pointer. 
The row and col elements of darray are used in the Locate statement to move the cursor 
to the position described by the row and col variables, and an X is printed to the screen.
Lines 46 through 48 deallocate the darray memory array. The order of deallocation 
is important here. You must deallocate the embedded array first, before you deallocate 
the base type array. If you deallocate the base type array without deallocating the 
embedded array, the embedded array elements will remain in memory causing a 
memory leak. The rule of thumb here is to deallocate the inner most pointer elements 
first, and then work out toward the base pointer element. Line 50 deallocates the base 
type elements, only after the darray elements have been deallocated. The program is 
then closed in the usual way.

When you run the program you should see something similar to the following 
output. There should be nine X's, however since the random number generator is working 
within a 10 by 10 space, it is possible two X's may occupy the same row and column, so 
you may not see all nine X's.

While this may seem confusing at first, if you look at the code you will see a 
recurring pattern. The pointer elements are selected using the pointer index method, 
followed by the dot notation to select the individual type elements. You start with the 
base type, in this case myType, index the pointer, and then select the elements using the 
dot notation, in this case darray. Since darray is a pointer, it is selected using a pointer 
index, followed by the dot notation to select the row and col elements. The pattern, 
pointer index, dot notation, pointer index, dot notation would be used for as many levels 
as needed to resolve a individual element within the memory array.
The following diagram shows the memory layout of the program.

MyType[0]&nbsp;­&gt;&nbsp;.darray[0]&nbsp;­&gt;&nbsp;.row,&nbsp;.col
.darray[1]&nbsp;­&gt;&nbsp;.row,&nbsp;.col
.darray[2]&nbsp;­&gt;&nbsp;.row,&nbsp;.col
MyType[1]&nbsp;­&gt;&nbsp;.darray[0]&nbsp;­&gt;&nbsp;.row,&nbsp;.col
.darray[1]&nbsp;­&gt;&nbsp;.row,&nbsp;.col
.darray[2]&nbsp;­&gt;&nbsp;.row,&nbsp;.col
MyType[2]&nbsp;­&gt;&nbsp;.darray[0]&nbsp;­&gt;&nbsp;.row,&nbsp;.col
.darray[1]&nbsp;­&gt;&nbsp;.row,&nbsp;.col
.darray[2]&nbsp;­&gt;&nbsp;.row,&nbsp;.col

You can see the pattern reflected in the diagram. If row were a type pointer, then 
you would just repeat the pattern of index, dot notation on row to resolve the next level 
of elements. This type of data structure gives you a lot of flexibility in your programming. 
There is no need to have three darray elements for each base element; myType[0] may 
point to 4 elements and myType[2] may point to 1 element. You would need to add an 
additional field in myType to indicate how many darray elements were each myType 
element, but that is a minor adjustment and easily programmed. What this concept gives 
you is tight control over your data structures, efficient use of memory and at a relatively 
low cost in code.
Function Pointers in Types
Once you have created a type definition, you will usually need to create one or 
more subroutines or functions that act on that data. By using function pointers, you can 
group the code that acts on this data right along with the data itself. This gives you a 
powerful capability to organize your data into code objects that operate as a single unit. 
This is one of the ideas behind OOP, or object oriented programming; encapsulating data 
and the methods (subroutines and functions) that operate on that data into a single 
entity. While FreeBasic doesn't yet support object oriented programming, you can derive 
some of the benefits of OOP by using functions pointers along with data when you create 
your type definitions.
You define a function (or subroutine) pointer by declaring a prototype function 
declaration with the type element name. The following code snippet shows a typical 
declaration.

Type&nbsp;myObject
arg1&nbsp;As&nbsp;Integer
arg2&nbsp;As&nbsp;Integer
ret&nbsp;As&nbsp;Integer

     135


myFunc&nbsp;As&nbsp;Function(arg1&nbsp;As&nbsp;Integer,&nbsp;arg2&nbsp;As&nbsp;Integer)&nbsp;As&nbsp;Integer
End&nbsp;Type
Declare&nbsp;Function&nbsp;typeFunc(arg1&nbsp;As&nbsp;Integer,&nbsp;arg2&nbsp;As&nbsp;Integer)&nbsp;As&nbsp;Integer
...
Dim&nbsp;Obj&nbsp;as&nbsp;myObject
Obj.myFunc&nbsp;=&nbsp;@typeFunc
...
Function&nbsp;typeFunc(arg1&nbsp;As&nbsp;Integer,&nbsp;arg2&nbsp;As&nbsp;Integer)&nbsp;As&nbsp;Integer
...
End&nbsp;Function

The type definition is defined using data in the normal manner, along with a field, 
myFunc, that is defined As Function. When a field is defined As Function or As Sub, this 
creates a pointer to the function or subroutine. Notice that the type definition of myFunc 
doesn't include a function, but does include the parameter and return types. Since this is 
a pointer field, the name isn't required, but the parameters and return type in the 
prototype declaration, must match the actual function in order for the compiler to do type 
checking on the pointer field. 
The Declare statement following the type is needed as a forward reference so that 
the compiler knows that a function is defined somewhere in the code. If you left out the 
declaration, you would get a variable not declared error when trying the to compile the 
code. You create an instance of the type using the Dim statement, just as you have seen 
in the other examples. Since myFunc is a pointer, you can't use it until you initialize the 
pointer and you do this by using the Addressof operator on the real function's name. This 
will store the address of the function in myFunc, which is used when calling the function. 
The real function must be coded of course, so that you actually have some code to call 
when using the function pointer.
The following program illustrates creating and using a function pointer in a type 
def.

Listing 10.8: type-func.bas

Analysis: Lines 4 through 9 define a type with both integer data fields and a 
function pointer field. MyFunc is defined As Function along with the function prototype. 
This sets up myFunc as a function pointer. The Declaration statement in line 12 is used as 
a forward reference to the actual function code. If you did not supply the declaration, you 
would get a variable not found error on line 16. Line 14  creates a variable of the type 
and line 16 uses the Addressof operator to initialize the function pointer to the address of 
typeFunc, the actual function. Lines 18 and 19 initialize the data fields, arg1 and arg2. 
Line 21 actually calls the function with the proper arguments. Notice that the dot notation 
is used in calling the function, myFunc as well as passing the data to the function. Obj.ret 
olds the functions return value.
The program is closed using the Sleep and End commands, followed by the 
function definition. Whenever you create a function pointer, you must have some 
corresponding function code in order to pass the address of that code to the function 
pointer.

When you run the program, you should see the following output.

&nbsp;Func&nbsp;return&nbsp;is&nbsp;6
Output 10.8: Output of type-func.bas

As you can see, function pointers are quite simple to define and use. Not only is 
your data encapsulated within a single code object, the methods that act on that data are 
also contained within that same object, giving you a powerful way to organize your data 
structures. The example program is quite simple of course, but you can use this concept 
to reduce the complexity of your code. Suppose you are writing a game and the enemy 
units have been defined using a type definition. By also including the subroutines or 
functions that act on that data within the type definition, you have a single code object 
that fully describes an enemy. If you need to make changes to the enemy code, you only 

     137


have to update a single code object, rather than a scattered bunch of variables and 
subroutines.
This method also enables you to pass information to functions or subroutines as a 
single unit, by simply declaring a parameter as the type definition, and you have access 
to both the data and methods within the called function. This makes the code much more 
reliable and easier to maintain. It also enables you to generalize the code so that when 
you create these type of objects, they can be used in other programs.
Forward References
There may be a time when you need to create two type definitions that reference 
each other. Since FreeBasic is a single pass compiler, this poses a problem since the 
compiler will encounter a reference to a type that hasn't been defined yet. The solution is 
to create a forward reference of the second type. You do this by using the Type-As 
keywords, without the End Type.  For example, suppose you have two types Type1 and 
Type2. Type1 references Type2 and Type2 references Type1. It doesn't matter what order 
you define the types, you will generate an error in the compiler, because each type has a 
reference that hasn't been defined yet. In order for the compiler to compile successfully 
you need to create a forward reference to the second type, and then use that reference 
in defining the first type. The following code snippet illustrates this concept.

'Forward&nbsp;reference
Type&nbsp;FT&nbsp;as&nbsp;Type2

Type&nbsp;Type1
&nbsp;fType&nbsp;as&nbsp;FT
End&nbsp;Type

Type&nbsp;Type2
&nbsp;fType&nbsp;as&nbsp;Type2
End&nbsp;Type

The code Type&nbsp;FT&nbsp;as&nbsp;Type2 creates the forward reference that is in turn used in 
the Type1 definition to refer to Type2, fType&nbsp;as&nbsp;FT. FT and Type2 are actually the same 
thing, FT is just an alias for the Type2 definition. Whenever you need to have one or mote 
type definitions refer to each other, you will need to create forward declarations for the 
the types that have not been defined when referenced.
Bit Fields
There is yet another data type that can be used in type definitions, the bit field. Bit 
fields are defined as variable_name: bits As DataType. The variable name must be 
followed with a colon and the number of bits, followed by the data type. Only integer 
data types are allowed within a bit field. Bit fields are useful when you need to keep track 
of boolean type information, such as if a pixel is on or off. The following program 
illustrates using bit fields within a type definition.

Print&nbsp;"Bit&nbsp;field&nbsp;2:&nbsp;";myBitType.b2

Sleep
End
Listing 10.9: bitfield.bas

Analysis: Lines 3 through 6 define a type with two bit fields. B1 is defined as 1 bit, 
and b2 is defined as 4 bits. Line 8 creates a variable of the type definition. Line 10 sets 
b1 to 1. Since b1 is defined a 1 bit, the only valid values are 0 or 1. Line 11 sets b2 to 
1101. Here there are four bits so you can have a range of 0000 to 1111. Lines 13 and 14 
print out the values of the bits. The program is closed in the usual way.

When you run the program you should see the following output.

Bit&nbsp;field&nbsp;1:&nbsp;1
Bit&nbsp;field&nbsp;2:&nbsp;13
Output 10.9: Output of bitfield.bas

The data type of the bit field determines how many bits you can declare in a bit 
field. Since an integer is 32 bits long, you could declare up to 32 bits in the field. 
However, in most cases you would declare a single bit for each field, and use a number of 
fields to define the bit masking that you wish to use. Using a single bit simplifies the 
coding you need to do to determine if a bit is set or cleared.
The Field Property
When you create a variable of a type definition, the type is padded in memory. The 
padding allows for faster access of the type members since the type fields are aligned on 
a 4 byte or Word boundary. However, this can cause problems when trying to read a type 
record from a file that is not padded. You can use the use field property to change the 
padding of a type definition. The field keyword is used right after the type name and can 
have the values 1, for 1 byte alignment (no padding), 2 for 2 byte alignment and 4 for 4 
byte alignment. To define a type with no padding you would use the following syntax.

     139


Type&nbsp;myType&nbsp;field&nbsp;=&nbsp;1
&nbsp;v1&nbsp;As&nbsp;Integer
v2&nbsp;As&nbsp;Byte
End&nbsp;Type

For 2 byte alignment you would use field = 2. If no field = property is assigned, 
then the padding will be 4 bytes. If you are reading a type definition created by FreeBasic 
using the default alignment, then you do not need to use the field property.

If you reading a Quick Basic type record, then you will need to use field = 1, as QB used 
byte alignment by default.

Type Initialization
You can initialize a type definition when you dimension the type just as you can 
any of the intrinsic variables. The following code snippet illustrates the syntax.

Type&nbsp;aType
&nbsp;a&nbsp;As&nbsp;Integer
&nbsp;b&nbsp;As&nbsp;Byte
&nbsp;c&nbsp;As&nbsp;String
End&nbsp;Type
Dim&nbsp;myType&nbsp;As&nbsp;aType&nbsp;=&gt;&nbsp;(12345,&nbsp;12,&nbsp;"Hello")

In the Dim statement, the arrow operator is used to signal the compiler that you 
are initializing the type variable. The type element values must be enclosed in 
parenthesis, and separated by commas. The order of the value list corresponds to the 
order of the type elements, where a will be set to 12345, b to 12 and c to “Hello”. The 
following short program initializes a type using this syntax.

Listing 10.10: type-init.bas

Analysis: Lines 4 through 8 define a type definition. Line 11 dimensions the type 
variable and sets the filed elements to the listed values. The order of the values 
correspond to the order of the field elements. Line 14 through 18 prints the type values 
to the screen. The program is then closed in the usual way.

When you run the program you should the following output.

&nbsp;12345
&nbsp;12
Hello
Output 10.10: Output of type-init.bas

Initializing a type definition in a Dim statement is useful when you need to have a 
set of initial values for a type, or values that will not change during program execution. 
Since the values are known at compile time, the compiler can doesn't have to spend 
cycles loading the values during runtime.
Unions
Unions look similar to Types in their definition.

Union&nbsp;aUnion
b&nbsp;As&nbsp;Byte
s&nbsp;As&nbsp;Short
i&nbsp;As&nbsp;Integer
End&nbsp;Union

If this were a Type, you could access each field within the definition. For a Union, 
you can only access one field at any given time; all the fields within a Union occupy the 
same memory segment, and the size of the Union is the size of the largest member. In 
this case, the Union would occupy four bytes, the size of an Integer, with the b field 
occupying 1 byte and the s field occupying 2 bytes within the 4 byte integer space. Each 
field starts at the first byte, so the s field would include the b field, and the i field would 
include both the b field and the s field. The following program illustrates this concept.

Listing 10.11: union.bas

Analysis: Line 4 through 8 define the example union. Line 10 defines a variable of 
the union definition. Line 13 sets the integer field to a value that will overlap the b and s 
fields. Lines 15 through 17 print out the values of each field of the union in binary so that 
you can see the overlap of the values. The program is closed in the usual way.

When you run the program you should the following output.

Output 10.11: Output of union.bas

You can easily see the overlapped values in the output. While a union is useful on 
its own, you can combine a union with a type definition to create extremely flexible and 
efficient data structures.
Types in Unions
A good example of using a type definition in a union is the Large_Integer definition 
found in winnt.bi. The Large_Integer data type is used in a number of Windows functions 
within the C Runtime Library. The following code snippet shows the Large_Integer 
definition.
142


union&nbsp;LARGE_INTEGER
type
LowPart&nbsp;as&nbsp;DWORD
HighPart&nbsp;as&nbsp;LONG
end&nbsp;type
QuadPart&nbsp;as&nbsp;LONGLONG
end&nbsp;union

The Dword data type is defined in windef.bi as an Uinteger, type&nbsp;DWORD&nbsp;as&nbsp;
uinteger, and the Longlong type is defined as a Longint, type&nbsp;LONGLONG&nbsp;as&nbsp;longint. A 
Long is the same as an integer. Remember that a type occupies contiguous memory 
locations, so the HighPart field follows the LoPwart part field in memory, the type 
occupies the same memory segment as the QuadPart field. When you set QuardPart to a 
large integer value, you are also setting the values of the type fields, which you can then 
extract as the LowPart and HighPart. You can also do the reverse, that is by setting the 
LowPart and HighPart of the type, you are setting the value of the QuadPart field.
As you can see, using a type within a union is an easy way to set or retrieve 
individual values of a component data type without resorting to a lot of conversion code. 
The layout of the memory segments does the conversion for you, providing that the 
memory segments make sense within the context of the component type. In the 
Large_Integer case, the LowPart and HighPart have been defined to return the 
appropriate component values. Using values other than Dword and Long would not return 
correct values for LowPart and HighPart. You need to make sure when defining a type 
within a union, you are segmenting the union memory segment correctly within the type 
definition.
Unions in Types
A union within a type definition is an efficient way to manage data when one field 
within a type can only be a single value. The most common example of this is the Variant 
data type found in other programing languages.

FreeBasic does not have a Variant data type at this time. However, when classes are 
added to FreeBasic, it will be quite easy to create a Variant data type and overload the 
arithmetic operators to create a Variant that behaves just like the intrinsic data types. 
Classes are planned for a future version of FreeBasic.

If you can only access a single field within a union, how do you know which field to 
access when a union is contained within a type definition? Usually you will include an 
identifier field within the type, but outside the union, that identifies which union field to 
access. The following program illustrates this concept by creating a simple Variant data 
type.

Listing 10.12: simplevariant.bas

Analysis: Line 4 and 5 define the union ids. These values will be used to determine 
which field within the union to access. Lines 20 through 26 define a subroutine that will 
print the value of the union field based on the id. If the id field is VString, then the s field 
within the union is printed. If the id field is VInteger, then the i field is printed. Line 29 
sets the id field to Vstring and line 30 sets the union field s to a string. The PrintVariant 
144


subroutine is called in line 32 to print out the value. Line 34 clears the allocated memory 
of the dynamic string by setting the union field s to an empty string.
Line 36 sets the id field to an integer, and the value of the union field i is set to 
300. Line 39 calls the PrintVariant subroutine to print the integer value. The program is 
then closed in the usual way.

Caution There are two subtle danger in this program that may not be readily 
apparent. Remember that a dynamic string is actually a pointer to an allocated memory 
segment. The union field s is actually a pointer to this memory segment. Since the fields 
s and i overlap in memory, setting i to a value also sets s to a value; that is, in the 
program i is set to 300, which also sets s to 300. Since s is a pointer, trying to access s 
after setting i will access memory location 300, which will be garbage data and may 
cause the program to crash. 
The other problem with this program is that it can potentially lead to a memory 
leak while the program is running. The string value is an allocated memory segment. 
Setting the integer value, overwrites the pointer address in s, which means you have lost 
the pointer address to the memory segment. The string data still exists in memory, but 
now that data is lost, causing a memory leak. This is why the string value in the union 
was set to an empty string before setting the integer value. Setting the string value to an 
empty string deallocates the string data and frees the string pointer.
When using pointers within a union, great care must be taken to insure that the 
pointer is pointing to the correct memory location, and that they are deallocated correctly 
to prevent memory leaks.

When you run the program you should see the following output.

String&nbsp;value:&nbsp;This&nbsp;is&nbsp;a&nbsp;string.
Integer&nbsp;value:&nbsp;300
Output 10.12: Output of simplevariant.bas

Using a combination of unions and types within a program allows to design custom 
data types that have a lot of flexibility, but care must be taken to ensure that you are 
using the data constructs correctly. Improper use of these data types can lead to hard-to-
find bugs. The benefits however, out-weigh the risks and once mastered, are a powerful 
programming skill.
A Look Ahead
There are times when you will need values that do not change during a program. 
These values are called Symbolic Constants and are the subject of the next chapter.

     145


11 Symbolic Constants
Constants are values that do not change during the life of the program. Constants 
are like variables in that the name of the constant refers to the defined value, but unlike 
a variable, these values cannot be changed in the program. There are two important 
reasons why constants should be used in your program. One, they help to document the 
program. Suppose in your role-playing game you have a weapon such as a broadsword. If 
you define the broadsword as a constant, which you can do with #Define&nbsp;broadsword&nbsp;
12, you can then refer to the weapon id as broadsword, rather than 12. The number 12 
imparts no real information when you see it in the code; broadsword on the the other 
hand is quite clear and understandable. 
The second reason to use a constant is code maintenance. There may come a time 
when working on your role-playing game that you need to change the value of the 
broadsword id. If you have defined the id as a constant, you only need to change it in a 
single location, the place where you defined the constant. If you had just used the 
number 12, you would have to search through the code and change each instance where 
12 referred to the broadsword. If the program is of any length at all, you will probably 
miss a reference or two, introducing bugs into your program. Bugs that may be difficult to 
locate and fix.

One of the things you will discover as you progress in your programming adventure is 
that programs are dynamic, not static. There is always a new technique being 
developed that you can use, a new compiler function that will improve your program, 
and bugs that need to be fixed. The only thing that stays the same in a program is the 
fact that programs continually evolve over time. You should always keep in mind that 
when you write a program, you will probably end up making changes to the program, 
and you should code accordingly. It may be easier to write 12 than it is to write 
broadsword, but a few extra seconds of typing will save you hours when you need to 
change 12 to 120.

#Define as a Constant
You have already seen #Define at work in several of the example programs. 
#Define is a preprocessor command, where the defined symbol is physically replaced in 
the code by the associated value. #Define of course is used in a number of situations, 
from creating macros to conditional compilation, but it is also useful for creating 
constants within your program. If you look through the declaration files in the include 
folder of your FreeBasic installation, you will see that #Define is used extensively for 
constant values. Since the compiler replaces the symbol   definition with the defined 
value, it is a very efficient coding method. It is also quite easy to use, as the following 
code snippet illustrates.

'Define&nbsp;directions
#Define&nbsp;north&nbsp;1
#Define&nbsp;neast&nbsp;2
#Define&nbsp;east&nbsp;3
#Define&nbsp;seast&nbsp;4

146


#Define&nbsp;south&nbsp;5
#Define&nbsp;west&nbsp;6
#Define&nbsp;swest&nbsp;7
#Define&nbsp;nwest&nbsp;8

Once you define the constants, you can use the symbols in your programs just as 
you would the values. You have already seen this technique used in some of the example 
programs presented in the book.
The Const Keyword
The Const keyword is another method to define constants in your program. The 
format is similar to the #define, as the following code snippet illustrates.

Const&nbsp;xk&nbsp;=&nbsp;Chr(255)
Const&nbsp;key_up&nbsp;=&nbsp;xk&nbsp;&amp;&nbsp;Chr(72)
Const&nbsp;key_dn&nbsp;=&nbsp;xk&nbsp;&amp;&nbsp;Chr(80)
Const&nbsp;key_rt&nbsp;=&nbsp;xk&nbsp;&amp;&nbsp;Chr(77)
Const&nbsp;key_lt&nbsp;=&nbsp;xk&nbsp;&amp;&nbsp;Chr(75)

These constants are the character codes returned by Inkey for the arrow keys. 
Inkey returns a two byte string for the extended keys, Chr(255) + the extended key 
character code. Inkey is covered in detail in the chapter on Console Programming. To use 
these constaints in your program you would just use key_lt for example to check to see if 
the left arrow key had been pressed.
Const Versus #Define
As you can see Const and #Define are similar constructs. The question then 
becomes, which one should you use? Remember that #Define replaces the symbol name 
with the text following the symbol. If you wrote  #Define&nbsp;key_up&nbsp;xk&nbsp;&amp;&nbsp;Chr(72), then 
the code xk&nbsp;&amp;&nbsp;Chr(72) would be replace the symbol key_up. If you had several places 
where you used key_up, then there would be several instances of  xk&nbsp;&amp;&nbsp;Chr(72)&nbsp;in your 
program. You can see that by using #Define in this case your program would be 
performing the same calculation over and over. It is much more efficient to use Const in 
this case, since the calculation is only done once, when the Const is defined. 
On the other hand, if you are defining single constant values, such as compass 
directions, then using a #Define is preferable to using Const. For a Const value, the 
compiler must do a lookup in the symbol table and it is much more efficient to simple 
replace the symbol with the value using #Define.
Enumerations
Enumerations are sequential values that the compiler can calculate for you. To 
create an enumeration, you use enclose the values within an Enum-End Enum block. The 
compass direction defined above could also be defined as an enumeration.

Enum&nbsp;compass
north&nbsp;=&nbsp;1

     147


neast
east
seast
south
west
swest
nwest
End&nbsp;Enum

In this example, neast will be defined as 2, with east defined as 3 and so on. If no 
starting value is set, enumerations start at 0. You can also change the sequence within an 
enumeration by setting a symbol to a value using =, and any following symbols will be 
incremented from this starting point.

Enum&nbsp;compass
north&nbsp;=&nbsp;1
east
south
west
neast&nbsp;=&nbsp;10
seast
swest
nwest
End&nbsp;Enum

In this example, the value of seast will be 11, swest will be 12 and so on. Once you 
define an enumeration, you can create variables of the Enum and use that variable within 
your program.

Dim&nbsp;aCompass&nbsp;as&nbsp;compass

You can then use the enumeration values to initialize the variable. The following 
code snippet set aCompass to the north-defined value.

aCompass&nbsp;=&nbsp;north

Caution The compiler does not check to see if the value being passed to the Enum 
variable is within the defined range of the enumeration. It is the responsibility of the 
programmer to ensure that the Enum variable contains the correct values.

A Look Ahead
In the next chapter you will see how to create and work with Arrays in FreeBasic.

148


     149


12 Arrays
Arrays are probably the single most useful programming construct  that is 
available to you in FreeBasic. Many problems that you will try to solve with a 
programming solution involve data arranged in tabular format, and arrays are perfect for 
managing this type of data. Understanding arrays is crucial skill in becoming a competent 
programmer.
Arrays are contiguous memory segments of a single or composite data type. You 
can think of an array as a table, with rows and columns of data. An array can have one or 
more rows, and each row can have one or columns. The number of rows and columns 
define the dimensions of the array. FreeBasic uses the row-major scheme for arrays, 
which means that the first dimension references the row in an array that has more than 
one dimension. FreeBasic supports up to eight dimensions in an array.
One-Dimensional Arrays
An array with a single row is called a one-dimensional array. If an array is a single-
dimensional array, then the row is not defined in the declaration, only the number of 
columns in the row. Since an array requires a minimum of one row, the row is understood 
to exist in this case. The following code snippets create a single-dimension integer array 
using the different array definition schemes available in FreeBasic.

Dim&nbsp;myArray(10)&nbsp;as&nbsp;Integer

This will define an array with a single row and 11 columns, with column indexes 
(numbers) ranging from 0 to 10. The base array index is 0 if the lower bound of the array 
is not defined. This behavior can be changed using the Option&nbsp;Base&nbsp;n compiler 
directive. Setting Option Base 1 with the above example would result in an array with 10 
columns, with the indexes ranging from 1 to 10. The Option Base directive must be 
defined before dimensioning any arrays.

Dim&nbsp;myArray(1&nbsp;to&nbsp;10)&nbsp;as&nbsp;Integer

This example will define a single-dimension array with 10 columns, with indexes 
ranging from 1 to 10. 
One-Dimensional Array Indexes
You access each element of an array using an index value. In the case of a single-
dimension array, the index would refer to a column number in the default row. The format 
is to use the array variable, with the index surrounded by parenthesis.

myArray(5)&nbsp;=&nbsp;7

This would set the value of column 5 of myArray to 7. 

150


myInt&nbsp;=&nbsp;myArray(5)

This will set the value of myInt to the current value of column 5 in myArray.
Two-Dimensional Arrays
A two-dimensional array is an array that has more than one row, along with the 
defined columns. A two-dimensional array is like a table, with a defined number of rows, 
where each row has a defined number of columns. The following code snippet defined an 
array using the default method.

Dim&nbsp;myArray(2,&nbsp;10)&nbsp;as&nbsp;Integer

The first dimension defines the number of rows in the array, while the second 
dimension defines the number of columns in each row. In this example, the array has 3 
rows, numbered 0 to 2, and each row has 11 columns, numbered 0 to 10, if Option Base 
has not been defined. If Option Base 1 had been used, then the row indexes would range 
from 1 to 2, and the column indexes would range from 1 to 10.
You can also define the lower and upper bounds of the array.

Dim&nbsp;myArray(1&nbsp;to&nbsp;2,&nbsp;1&nbsp;to&nbsp;10)&nbsp;as&nbsp;Integer

This definition would set the number of rows to 2, numbered 1 to 2 and the 
number of columns to 10, numbered 1 to 10.
Two-Dimensional Array Indexes
To access the array elements you would use two indexes. The first index selects 
the row, and the second index selects a column within that row.

myArray(1,&nbsp;5)&nbsp;=&nbsp;7

This code would set column 5 in row 1 to 7.

myInt&nbsp;=&nbsp;myArray(1,&nbsp;5)

This code would set myInt to the current value contained within column 5 of row 1 
of myArray.
Multi-Dimensional Arrays
For arrays of three or more dimensions, you would use the same format as listed 
above, taking into account the progression of the array dimensions. For a three-
dimensional array, the first dimension would be the row, the second the column, the third 
would be the z-order, or depth, of each column. For example, to define a cube in space, 
you would use the y,x,z format, where y defines the vertical axis, x defines the horizontal 
axis and z defines the depth axis. To create an array in this format you could define the 
array as Dim&nbsp;myCube(y,&nbsp;x,&nbsp;z)&nbsp;as&nbsp;Integer. MyCube(10,&nbsp;10,&nbsp;10) would create a cube 
     151


with 11 vertical units, 0 to 10, 11 horizontal units, 0 to 10 and 10 depth units, 0 to 10. To 
access the center of the cube, you would use iCenter&nbsp;=&nbsp;myCube(5,&nbsp;5,&nbsp;5). 
You will probably never need to use arrays of more than three dimensions, unless 
you are doing some advanced mathematical calculations. However, if you need to use 
higher-dimensional arrays, the same principles apply.

Listing 12.1: arrayindex.bas

Analysis: Line 4 creates a two-dimensional array with two rows, with each row 
having ten columns. The working variables i and j are also declared on the same line. 
Lines 7 through 11 load some random data into the array. A nested For-Next loop is the 
common way to access multi-dimensional arrays. The variable i will select the row 
indexes while the j variable will access the column indexes.
Lines 14 through 18 will print the values stored in the array. The format is identical 
to the load code. The program is closed in the usual way.

When you run the program you should see the following output.

Output 12.1: Output of arrayindex.bas
Dynamic Arrays
The arrays described above are static arrays; the array size cannot change during 
program execution. You can also create dynamic arrays that can change size during 
execution. Dynamic arrays are useful for creating data structures such as stacks or 
queues.
In order to use dynamic arrays in your program you need to include the Option&nbsp;
Dynamic directive in your program. Static arrays, the arrays described above, are kept on 
the heap, but dynamic arrays are allocated from the computer's pool of memory so 
Option Dynamic is needed to tell the compiler to dynamically allocate the array. You can 
dimension a dynamic array in two ways. The first is to declare the array size in the Dim 
statement and then resize it using Redim or Redim&nbsp;Preserve. The second is to not specify 
the array size, use empty parenthesis, and then use Redim or Redim Preserve to size the 
array. Redim will size the array and clear the array contents. Redim Preserve will size the 
array and keep any existing data in th array.

There are a couple of exceptions to this. When declaring an array using variables for the 
index values, the array is implicitly dynamic. You can also declare an array without 
specifying index values, that is using an empty parentheses in the array declaration, 
and then use Redim to resize the array without specifying Option Dynamic.

The following program creates a simple integer stack and then manipulates

Listing 12.2: stack.bas

Analysis: In line the Option Dynamic directive is used to create the stack array 
using dynamic memory. Line 5 dimensions the working variables. The 0 index in the stack 
array will be used to indicate that the stack is empty. Even though this wastes one 
integer, it makes the code easier to implement. Line 8 through 14 defines the code to 
push a value on to the the stack. The parameters of the subroutine are the stack array, 
the top-of-stack variable, and the value to push on to the stack. You could determine the 
top of the stack using the Ubound function, however in a real stack implementation, you 
will probably need to pass the top-of-stack to other functions, and keeping the value in a 
variable will reduce the number of calculations the program must do. 
Line 10 increments the stack top variable, and line 12 uses Redim Preserve to 
resize the array, while keeping the existing data in the array. Line 13 set the new array 
location to the value passed to the subroutine.
Line 16 through 27 pops the top value of the stack, if the stack index is grater than 
zero, updates the top-of-stack variable and then returns the popped value. Line 19 and 
20 checks to make sure that the stack has some data. If the index is 0, the stack is 
empty. Lines 22 through 24 get the current value of the top stack item, updates the stack 
pointer variable and then resizes the stack using Redim Preserve. Lines 31 through 35 
use a For-Next loop to push 5 values on to the stack. Lines 40 through 44 pop the values 
off the stack. A Do-Loop is used to pop the values since when the stack is empty, the 
return value will be 0. Line 48 then cheks to see if all the values have been popped from 
the stack.
The program is closed in the usual way.

When you run the program you will see the following output.

Output 12.2: Output of stack.bas

Stacks have a wide range of uses, however most implementations use pointers 
since it is much faster to manipulate a pointer than it is an array. The advantage of an 
array is the simplicity of use, and the readability of the code, but if you need speed, you 
should use a pointer memory array for stacks.

You can only Redim or Redim Preserve the first index, that is the row, in a 
multidimensional array. 

Array Functions
There are a number of functions that you can use to manage arrays. The following 
table lists the array functions available in FreeBasic.

Function Syntax Comment
Clear Clear array, value, 
num_bytes

Sets num_bytes in array to 
byte value.
Erase Erase array Erases dynamic arrays from 
memory, or clears static 
arrays.
Lbound B = Lbound(array)
B = Lbound(array, 
dimension)

Returns the lowest index of 
a single or multidimensional 
array. The dimension 
parameter is the dimension 
to check in a 
multidimensional array 
where the first dimension is 

156


Function Syntax Comment
1, the second dimension is 
2, and so on.
Option Dynamic Option Dynamic Allocates arrays into 
dynamic memory by 
default.
Option Static Option Static Clears a previous Option 
Dynamic. All subsequent 
arrays will be allocated on 
the heap.
Preserve Redim Preserve Preserves data in an array 
when resized using the 
Redim statement.
Redim Redim array(dimensions) as 
DataType

Resizes an array to size 
dimensions. 

Ubound B = Lbound(array)
B = Lbound(array, 
dimension)

Returns the highest index of 
a single or multidimensional 
array. The dimension 
parameter is the dimension 
to check in a 
multidimensional array 
where the first dimension is 
1, the second dimension is 
2, and so on.

Table 12.1: Array Functions

Out of all the functions, you will probably use the Lbound and Ubound functions 
the most, especially when working with dynamic arrays. The following program uses both 
functions to get the size of a two dimensional array.

Listing 12.3: ulbound.bas

Analysis: Line 2 set the compiler directive Option Dynamic so that the array is 
allocated in dynamic memory. Line 5 creates a dynamic array with no dimensions 
specified. Line 7 uses Redim to create a two-dimensional array. Lines 10 through 15 print 
the upper and lower bounds using Lbound and Ubound respectively. Notice that the 
dimension parameter is used to specify which dimension to get the lower and upper 
bounds. 1 is used to get the bounds for the first dimension, and 2 is used to get the 
second dimension.
Lines 20 through 29 resize the first dimension of the array and print the new lower 
and upper indexes. Line 21 gets the current upper bound of the first dimension, 1 is 
added to that value and then Redim is used in line 22 to resize the first dimension of the 
array. Lines 24 through 27 get the new bounds and print the values to the screen.
The program is closed in the usual way.

When you run the program you should see the following output.

Listing 12.4: Output of ulbound.bas

The first Redim sets the initial bounds for the array. The additional Redims increase 
the number of rows in the array, while leaving the number of columns in intact. Keep in 
mind that arrays in FreeBasic are table-like, where each row has the same number of 
columns.  Ragged arrays, where each row has a different number of columns, cannot be 
created in FreeBasic using arrays. You would have to use pointers to create a ragged 
array.
Arrays of Types
Type definitions allow you to group related data into a single entity, and often you 
will need more than one instance of a type to fully express the data. Arrays of types allow 
you create multiple instances of a type definition that can be easily managed using the 
arrays functions. An example of this usage may be an inventory system for your RPG, a 
series of document descriptions within an editor, and a set of employee records from a 
random access database.
You create arrays of types just as you would with any of the intrinsic data types. 
The following code snippet  illustrates the syntax.

Type&nbsp;myPoint
x&nbsp;As&nbsp;Integer
y&nbsp;As&nbsp;Integer
End&nbsp;Type
Type&nbsp;myLine
p1&nbsp;As&nbsp;myPoint
p2&nbsp;As&nbsp;myPoint
char&nbsp;As&nbsp;String&nbsp;*&nbsp;1
End&nbsp;Type
Dim&nbsp;myLineSet&nbsp;(1&nbsp;to&nbsp;3)&nbsp;as&nbsp;myLine

     159


The code defines a set of 3  lines, with endpoints p1 and p2, where each endpoint 
is located at row and col. The following program illustrates using this definition to print 
some lines to the console screen.

Listing 12.5: arrayoftypes.bas

Analysis: Lines 4 through 7 define the coordinates for the an endpoint of a line. 
Lines 10 through 14, define a line, with two endpoints and the character used to print the 
line on the console screen. Line 17 defines a set of three lines, and line 18 defines a 
working variable that will be used in a For-Next loop that will initialize and display the 
line.
Lines 23 through 89 define a subroutine that implements the Bresenham Line 
algorithm to print the line to the console screen. There are a number of resources on the 
Internet that explain the algorithm in detail and can be found using your favorite search 
engine.
Lines 92 through 94 define a function that will return a random integer in the 
range of lowerbound to upperbound, inclusive. Line 96 initializes the random number 
generator by seeding the generator with the current Timer value. Randomize Timer 
ensures that each call to Rnd will return a different random number. Without the 
Randomize statement, Rnd will return the same sequence of random number.
Line 98 through 109 initialize each line in the array and then calls the DrawLine 
subroutine to print the line. When accessing the fields of a type within an array, you must 
specify which array element you are accessing by using parentheses with an index value, 
162


jut as you would an intrinsic data type. You can then access each element within the type 
using the familiar dot notation you saw in the chapter on composite types. Notice that 
the syntax is similar to the syntax used in the type memory array example, and the rules 
are accessing type fields is the same.
Once each array element has been initialized and each line printed, the program is 
closed in the usual way.

When you run the program you should see something like the following output.

Your output will vary since the end points of the lines, and the line character are 
random generated.
Arrays in Types
As you saw in the chapter on composite types, type fields be both intrinsic and 
composite type. You can also create static arrays within a type definition. In the listing 
above, you can see that a line has two endpoints. Rather than using two distinct fields, 
you can create an array of endpoints that describe the line. The following code listing is a 
modification of the previous listing, using an array to describe the endpoints.

Listing 12.6: arrayintypes.bas

Analysis: This program is identical to the previous program, except that this 
program uses an array to describe the endpoints of the line. Only the changes to the 
program will discussed in this section.
Line 11 defines a single dimension array of endpoints that has two elements. In 
lines 97 through 110, the program initializes each line element. The outer loop selects 
each line type within the line set array. The inner For-Next loop then selects each 
endpoint element with the endpoint array. Notice that you an use Lbound and Ubound for 
this array, just as you can with the main array. Arrays within a type definition are true 
arrays, and all the functions available in FreeBasic can be used with embedded arrays. 
The inner j loop Lbound and Ubound use the outer loop specification,  myLineSet(i).pts, 
to select a line element within the line set array, and then the function is applied to the 
embedded array. The endpoints are then initialized using both the i and j specifications, 
myLineSet(i).pts(j).x&nbsp;=&nbsp;GetRandom(1,&nbsp;80). The variable i selects a line while j 
selects an endpoint  within the selected line. The dot notation is used to reference each 
field within the type definition, including the endpoint array. Again, the notation and 
principles are similar to a type memory array.
The program is closed in the usual way after printing all the lines.

The output of this program is the same as the previous program and is not shown 
here. Using an array for the endpoints enables you to easily extend the line definition to 
support not only lines, but triangles and squares. The following code snippet shows one 
possible definition.
166


Type&nbsp;myObj
objid&nbsp;As&nbsp;Integer
Union
&nbsp;myLine(1&nbsp;To&nbsp;2)&nbsp;As&nbsp;myPoint
myTriangle(1&nbsp;To&nbsp;3)&nbsp;As&nbsp;myPoint
mySquare(1&nbsp;To&nbsp;4)&nbsp;As&nbsp;myPoint
End&nbsp;Union
&nbsp;char&nbsp;As&nbsp;String&nbsp;*&nbsp;1
End&nbsp;Type

The objid field would indicate which type of object is contained within the 
definition. That is, a 1 may indicate a line, a 2 may indicate a triangle and a 3 may 
indicate a square. Since the definition defines a single object, a union is used to enclose 
the endpoint arrays to maximize memory usage. To print the object to the screen, you 
would examine the objid and then use the Lbound and Ubound on the appropriate 
endpoint array definition, printing the number of lines that correspond to the type of 
object. One further enhancement you can make to this program is to add a function 
pointer to the type definition, and then write print routines that correspond to the type of 
object being printed. Using this technique will enable you to further extend the 
usefulness of the code by simplifying the process of adding new objects to the type 
definition. For example, if you needed to be able to describe a cube, you would simply 
add an new array to the union, add a cube print function, and the type definition would 
be able to print a cube by simply adding a few lines of code, while keeping the original 
functionality intact.
Array Initialization
You can initialize an array with values when using the Dim statement in a manner 
similar to initializing any of the other intrinsic data types, and type definitions. The 
following code snippet illustrates the syntax using a one dimensional array.

Dim&nbsp;aArray(1&nbsp;to&nbsp;5)&nbsp;As&nbsp;Integer&nbsp;=&gt;&nbsp;{1,&nbsp;2,&nbsp;3,&nbsp;4,&nbsp;5}

This code snippet dimensions a ubyte array with 5 elements, then sets the 
elements to the list contained within the curly brackets. The arrow operator, =&gt; tells the 
compiler that the list following the Dim statement should be used to initialize the array. 
You can also dimension multidimensional arrays in the same manner, by specifying 
blocks of data enclosed within curly braces as the following code snippet illustrates.

Dim&nbsp;bArray(1&nbsp;to&nbsp;2,&nbsp;1&nbsp;to&nbsp;5)&nbsp;As&nbsp;Integer&nbsp;=&gt;&nbsp;{{1,&nbsp;2,&nbsp;3,&nbsp;4,&nbsp;5},&nbsp;_&nbsp;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;{6,&nbsp;7,&nbsp;8,&nbsp;9,&nbsp;10}}

In this example, the first block, {1, 2, 3, 4, 5}, corresponds to row 1, and the 
second block, {6, 7, 8, 9, 10}, corresponds to row 2. Remember that FreeBasic arrays are 
row-major, so the row is specified before the column. When you initialize an array in this 
manner, you must be sure that the number of elements defined will fit into the array.
The following programs initializes two arrays and print the values to the console.

Listing 12.7: arrayinit.bas

Analysis: Line 3 creates a single-dimension array and initializes the values of the 
array. Line 4 creates a two-dimensional array and initializes the both rows of the array. 
Line 9 through 11 print the contents of the first array to the screen and lines 15 through 
19 print the contents of the second to the screen. The program is then closed in the usual 
way.

When you run the program you should see the following output.

aArray(&nbsp;1&nbsp;):&nbsp;1

aArray(&nbsp;3&nbsp;):&nbsp;3

Listing 12.8: Output of arrayinit.bas

As you can see from the output, both arrays have been initialized correctly, and 
without using a loop to load the data into the array. You can initialize arrays of any size 
using this method, although large arrays get a bit hard to work with and it is important to 
maintain the proper order of data in the initialization block.
Type Array Initialization
Since you can initialize a type definition and an array, it stands to reason you can 
do the same with a type array. In the chapter on type definitions you saw the syntax for 
initializing a type, and here you have seen how to initialize an array. To initialize a type 
array, you use both the type initialization syntax with the array initialization syntax, as 
you would expect. The following code snippet illustrates this combined syntax.

Type&nbsp;aType
&nbsp;a&nbsp;As&nbsp;Integer
&nbsp;b&nbsp;As&nbsp;Byte
&nbsp;c(1&nbsp;To&nbsp;2)&nbsp;As&nbsp;Zstring&nbsp;*&nbsp;10
End&nbsp;Type
Dim&nbsp;As&nbsp;aType&nbsp;myType(1&nbsp;To&nbsp;2)&nbsp;=&gt;&nbsp;{&nbsp;(1234,&nbsp;12,&nbsp;{"Hello",&nbsp;"World"}),&nbsp;_

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;}

The curly brackets signify that this is an array initialization, while the parenthesis 
indicate the type initialization. Since the type has an embedded array, you use the curly 
brackets to load the data into the embedded array, just as you would a stand-alone array. 
If the embedded array was a multidimensional array, then you would need to wrap each 
row in { and } just as you would a stand-alone array. 
The following program shows how all this works together.

Listing 12.9: typearray-init.bas

Analysis: Lines 4 through 8 define the type definition. Line 11 dimensions and 
initializes the type definition array. The type elements are enclosed in parenthesis, while 
the embedded array is enclosed within curly brackets. Line 15 creates some working 
variables for the For-Next loops. Lines 18 through 28 print the values to the console 
screen using a With block. The program is closed in the usual way.

When you run the program you should see the following output.

CRT Array Functions
There are a few CRT functions that you can use to manipulate arrays. The following 
table lists the Mem* functions which are defined in string.bi.

Function Syntax Comment
Memchr Ptr = 
Memchr(@Array(start), 
byte_value, Ubound(Array))

Returns a pointer to 
byte_value in byte Array, or 
Null pointer if byte_value is 
not found. Memchr only 
works with byte arrays.

Memcpy Ptr = 
Memcpy(@ArrayTo(start), 
@ArrayFrom(start), 
num_bytes)

Copies num_bytes from 
ArrayFrom to ArrayTo and 
returns a pointer to ArratTo. 
Do not use this function if 
From and To overlap. Use 
Memmove instead.

Memmove Ptr = 
Memmem(@ArrayTo(start), 
@ArrayFrom(start), 
num_bytes)

Works the same as Memcpy 
but correctly handles 
overlapping memory 
segments.

Table 12.2: CRT Array Functions

The following program illustrates using Memchr to search for a byte within a byte 
array, and Memcpy to copy one array into another array.

Listing 12.10: memfunc.bas

Analysis: Line 3 includes the crt.bi header file so that Memchr and Memcpy will be 
available to the program. Both functions are located in string.bi, which is included when 
you include crt.bi. Line 5 creates two ubyte arrays, the first which is initialized with some 
byte data. Remember that the ubyte data type has a range of 0 to 255. Line 6 declares a 
ubyte pointer which will be the return value fr the Memchr function. Line 7 declares two 
working variables, index which will be used to calulate the array index of the Memchr 
search, and I which will be used to print the contents of bArray after the Memcpy 
operation.
Line 12 calls the Memchr function. The first parameter is the address of the first 
element of aArray, which has an index of 1, the value to find, which is 100, and the 
length of the array. If Memchr finds the byte in the array, it will return a pointer to the 
value. If it cannot find the byte, bret will be Null. Line 13 checks the return value to make 
sure that bret is not Null; using a Null pointer will cause the program to behave strangely 
or crash. 
Line 14 calculates the array index of the found byte. Bret contains the address of 
byte 100 in the array. @aArray(1) returns the address of the first element of the array. 
Since arrays are sequential memory locations, you can find the array index by 
172


subtracting the address of the first array element from bret, and then adding the lower 
bound index to the value. This will give you the index of the array element. Line 15 prints 
the calculated index value to the console.
Line 23 copies the values from aArray to bArray. Again, the address of the first 
element of each array is passed to function, along with the number of bytes to copy. The 
number of bytes to copy is passed to the function with the code Ubound(aArray) * 
Sizeof(Ubyte), which uses the number of elements in the array times the size of a ubyte. 
Lines 24 through 28 then print the values of bArray to screen to verify that the array was 
in fact copied. The program is closed in the usual way.

When you run the program you should see the following output.

Looking&nbsp;for&nbsp;byte&nbsp;100...

100&nbsp;found&nbsp;at&nbsp;index&nbsp;&nbsp;3

Copying&nbsp;aArray&nbsp;to&nbsp;bArray...

bArray(&nbsp;1&nbsp;)&nbsp;=&nbsp;65
bArray(&nbsp;2&nbsp;)&nbsp;=&nbsp;123
bArray(&nbsp;3&nbsp;)&nbsp;=&nbsp;100
bArray(&nbsp;4&nbsp;)&nbsp;=&nbsp;52
bArray(&nbsp;5&nbsp;)&nbsp;=&nbsp;255
Output 12.5: Output of memfunc.bas

As you can see from the output, both operations succeeded. Memcopy is 
extremely handy when you need to make a copy of an array. The function is much faster 
than using a For-Next, and there considerably less code to write.
Using the -exx Compiler Switch
The -exx compiler switch will enable error and bounds checking within your 
program. If you go outside the bounds of an array within your program, the compiler will 
generate an “out of bounds” error while the program is running. This is a great help in 
debugging your program, and finding problems associated with arrays. -exx will also 
inform of you of Null pointer assignments, so it is quite useful when working with pointers 
as well. If you are using FBIde select View-&gt;Settings from the menu and the FreeBasic 
tab in the settings dialog. Add -exx to the end of your compiler command string.
Using -exx does add quite of bit of additional code to your program, so once your 
program is functioning correctly, you will want to compile the program without the -exx 
switch.

     173


A Look Ahead
Manipulating date and time values is a common task in programming.  FreeBasic 
has a number of date and time functions that make working with date and time 
information quite easy, as you will see in the next chapter.

174


13 Date and Time Functions
Working with dates and time in many Basic languages can be problematic due to 
the lack of date and time functions. FreeBasic however, has a rich set of date and time 
functions, and when used in combination with the Format function, which you will see in 
the next chapter, you can easily handle any date or time problem you may encounter. 
Intrinsic Date and Time Functions
FreeBasic includes the standard date and time functions that you see in most Basic 
languages. The following table lists these functions.

Function Syntax Comment
Date B = Date Returns the current system 
date as a string.
Setdate B = Setdate(date_string) Sets the system date to 
date_string, returning 0 on 
success and non-zro on 
failure. Date string must be 
in one of the following 
formats: mm-dd-yy", "mm-
dd-yyyy", "mm/dd/yy", or 
"mm/dd/yyyy".
Settime B = Settime(time_string) Sets the system time to 
time_string, returning 0 on 
success and non-zero on 
failure. Time string must be 
in one of the following 
formats: "hh:mm:ss", 
"hh:mm", or "hh".
Time B = Time Returns the current system 
time as a string.
Timer B = Timer Returns the number of 
seconds since the computer 
was started as a double-
type value. If the computer's 
CPU supports the 
Performance Counter, than 
Timer has a resolution in 
microseconds. On 
computers without the 
Performance Counter, the 
resolution is 1/18 of a 
second.

End
Listing 13.1: datetime.bas

Analysis: Line 3 dimensions a double-type variable for use with the Timer function. 
Line 5 prints out the current system date. Line 6 prints out the current system time. Line 
7 prints out the number of seconds since the computer was started. Line 9 initializes the 
variable myTimer with the current Timer result plus 2 seconds. The Do-Until loop in lines 
10 through 12 loop until the 2 seconds have expired. The Sleep in line 11 allows the 
operating system to handle any other events while the computer is busy in the Do loop. 
Whenever you have an extended loop of this nature, you need to use a Sleep x 
command, where x is the number of milliseconds to wait. This will keep your program 
from consuming 100% CPU time and allow other processes to execute. The program is 
ended in the usual way.

When you run the program you should see something similar to the following 

output.

Current&nbsp;time&nbsp;is&nbsp;11:44:02
Current&nbsp;date&nbsp;is&nbsp;06­27­2006
Number&nbsp;of&nbsp;seconds&nbsp;since&nbsp;computer&nbsp;started:&nbsp;&nbsp;10710.42349851727
Pausing&nbsp;for&nbsp;2&nbsp;seconds...
Press&nbsp;any&nbsp;key&nbsp;to&nbsp;continue...
Output 13.1: Output of datetime.bas

176


As the example program illustrates, you can use the Timer function for delay loops. 
This is common in games that want to control the FPS, or frames-per-second, when using 
real-time animation techniques. In the code above, the initial Timer value is saved in a 
variable. Timer returns the number of seconds since the computer was started, so adding 
2 to this variable will create a 2 second interval. The Until portion of the loop checks to 
see if the current result of the Timer function is greater than the saved value, and exits 
when 2 seconds have elapsed.
Extended Date and Time Functions
In addition to the functions listed above, FreeBasic has several extended date and 
time functions that enable you to easily calculate date and time intervals, and extract 
different parts of a date or time number for use in your program. In order to use these 
functions you must include "vbcompat.bi" in your program. Most of these functions 
require a date serial, a double-type value that represents a date and time number. The 
date is stored in the integer portion of the double, while the time is stored in the 
fractional part of the double. 
DateAdd Function
The DateAdd function returns a future or past date or time based on a certain 
interval. The function requires a serial start date or time, an interval string and the 
number of intervals.

date_serial&nbsp;=&nbsp;DateAdd(interval_string,&nbsp;number_of_intervals,&nbsp;
start_date_serial)

The following list explains each of the parameters in order; that is, interval_string 
is 1 below, number_of_intervals is listed as 2, and so on, along with the return value.

 1. Interval string: This is a string that indicates what interval to add to the start 
date_serial.
 a) “yyyy”:&nbsp;years&nbsp;
&nbsp;b) “q”:&nbsp;quarters
&nbsp;c) “m”:&nbsp;months&nbsp;
&nbsp;d) “ww”:&nbsp;weeks&nbsp;
&nbsp;e) “d”,”w”,”y”:&nbsp;days&nbsp;
&nbsp;f) “h”:&nbsp;hours&nbsp;
&nbsp;g) “n”:&nbsp;minutes&nbsp;
 h) “s:”&nbsp;seconds
 2. Number of intervals: The number of intervals defined in interval_string to add to 
the passed date_serial.
 3. Date serial: The starting date in the calculation.
     177


 4. Return: Returns a date serial that is offset by intervals from the starting date.
The following program illustrates the DateAdd function.

Listing 13.2: dateadd.bas

Analysis: In line 3 the “vbcompat.bi” is included in the program. You need to 
include this file if you want to use the extended date time functions as well as the format 
function. Line 6 dimensions a double-type variable to hold the return value from the 
DtaeAdd function. Line 7 creates an integer variable to hold the interval, which is set to 
2. Line 8 creates a string that will hold the various interval strings. Line 10 prints the 
current interval number. Line 12 prints the current date using the Format function and the 
Now function. The Now function returns the current date and time as a date serial. The 
format function's format string “mm-dd-yyyy” will print a two digit month, a two digit day 
and a four digit year.
Lines 15 through 17 set the interval string for the DateAdd function, “yyyy” in this 
case, passes the interval string, interval and the current date serial, using the Now 
function. The calculated date is returned in nDate, which is passed to the Format function 
in line 17. Lines 18 through 45 use the same code blocks to calculate the result for each 
interval string.
Line 47 pints the current time. DateAdd works with time numbers as well as dates, 
and lines 50 through 60 illustrate the different time offsets. The Format function uses the 
format string “hh:mm:ss” in 47 which prints a 24-hour time. The same code blocks are 
used for the time calculations that were used in the date calculations, and the results are 
printed in the same fashion.

When you run the program your output should look similar to the following.

     179

Output 13.2: Output of datedd.bas

Using a negative interval number will return a past date, rather than a future date. 
Changing the variable interval in the above program to -2 will result in the following 
output. Notice that the date and time return values are two intervals in the past.

DateDiff Function
The DateDiff functions returns the difference between two date or time serials 
based on a certain interval. The function requires two date or time serials and an interval 
string. You can optionally specify the first day of the week or the first day of the year.

int_value&nbsp;=&nbsp;DateDiff(interval_string,&nbsp;date_serial1,&nbsp;date_serial2)
int_value&nbsp;=&nbsp;DateDiff(interval_string,&nbsp;date_serial1,&nbsp;date_serial2,&nbsp;
first_day_of_week)
int_value&nbsp;=&nbsp;DateDiff(interval_string,&nbsp;date_serial1,&nbsp;date_serial2,&nbsp;
first_day_of_week,&nbsp;first_day_of_year)

You can specify the first day of the week when using the “ww” interval but the 
default is to use the system setting. You can also specify which week belongs to which 
year when a week spans the end of one year and the beginning of the next year.

 1. Interval string: The interval strings are the same strings used in the DateAdd 
function.
 2. Date Serial 1: The first date or time of the difference.
 3. Date Serial 2: The second date or time of the difference.
 4. First Day of the week: Specifies the day number of the first day of the week. This is 
used when using the “ww”, or week,  interval string.
 a) Not specified: Sunday.
 b) 0: Local settings.
 c) 1: Sunday.
 d) 2: Monday.
 e) 3: Tuesday.
 f) 4: Wednesday.
 g) 5: Thursday.
 h) 6: Friday.
 i) 7: Saturday.
 5. First day of the year: Specifies what year a week will be associated with 
when the week spans years.
 a) 0: Local settings.
 b) 1: January 1 week.
 c) 2: First week having four days in the year.
     181


 d) 3: First full week of year.
 6. Return: Returns an integer value that represents the number of intervals 
between the two date or time values.

Listing 13.3: datediff.bas

Analysis: Line 3 includes the extended date and time functions contained in the 
vbcompat.bi include file. Line 5 dimensions two double-type variables to hold the current 
and past date. Line 8 gets the current date and time. Line 10 uses the DateValue function 
to convert the string date to a DateSerial value. Line thirteen prints the number of days 
that have elapsed since January 1, 2006.

When you run the program you should see output similar to the following.

Number&nbsp;of&nbsp;days&nbsp;since&nbsp;01/01/2006&nbsp;is&nbsp;225
Output 13.4: Output of datediff.bas
DatePart Function
The DatePart function returns a specific part of a DateSerial, using the specified 
interval. The function requires a DateSerial, the interval to return and optionally, the first 
day of the week and the first day of the year. The function returns an integer value 
representing the specified interval.

int_value&nbsp;=&nbsp;DatePart(interval_string,&nbsp;date_serial)

int_value&nbsp;=&nbsp;DatePart(interval_string,&nbsp;date_serial,&nbsp;first_day_of_week)
int_value&nbsp;=&nbsp;DatePart(interval_string,&nbsp;date_serial,&nbsp;first_day_of_week,&nbsp;
first_day_of_year)

1. Interval string: The interval strings are the same strings used in the DateAdd 
function.
2. Date Serial: A date or time serial number.
3. First Day of the week: Specifies the day number of the first day of the week. The 
values are the same as those listed in the DateDiff function.
4. First day of the year: Specifies what year a week will be associated with when the 
week spans years. The values are the same as those listed in the DateDiff function.
5. Return: Returns an integer representing the interval value.

number. Line 16 prints the minute number. Line 17 prints the second number. The 
program is closed in the usual way.

     183


When you run the program you should see something similar to the following.

Day&nbsp;number&nbsp;is&nbsp;15
Week&nbsp;number&nbsp;is&nbsp;33
Month&nbsp;number&nbsp;is&nbsp;8
Hour&nbsp;is&nbsp;9
Minutes&nbsp;are&nbsp;52
Seconds&nbsp;are&nbsp;58
Output 13.5: Output of datepart.bas

The values you see will depend on the current date and time setting of your 
computer. 
DateSerial Function
The DateSerial function will return a double-type DateSerial value based on the 
passed year, month and day.  The date value returned by DateSerial has no time 
component.

date_serial&nbsp;=&nbsp;DateSerial(year,&nbsp;month,&nbsp;day)

1. Year: The year component of the date.
2. Month: The month component of the date.
3. Day: The day component of the the date.
4. Return: Returns a DateSerial that is the value of the year, month and day 
components.

Listing 13.5: dateserial.bas

Analysis: Line 3 includes the extended date and time functions in the program. 
Line 5 dimensions a double-type variable which will contain the date serial value. Lines 8 
and 9 create a date serial using the Datepart function to extract the year, month and day 
components from the current system date. Line 10 uses the Format function to print the 
date to the console screen.

When you run the program you should see the current system date.

Current&nbsp;date&nbsp;is&nbsp;08/15/2006
Output 13.6: Output of dateserial.bas

Of course it is a bit silly to use the DatePart function when you could simply use 
the Now function to return the current system date, but this program shows how both 
function could be used together in a program. In a real program, the year, month and day 
values would be probably be coming from an external source which would need to be 
combined to create a date serial that would then be used for a date calculation.
DateValue Function
The DateValue function takes a string as it argument and returns a date serial 
value. The date string must be in the same format as the regional settings of the 
computer. 

date_serial&nbsp;=&nbsp;DateValue(date_string)

1. Date String: A date string in the current regional setting format. DateValue will only 
convert a date string, not a time string.
2. Return: A DateSerial representing the date string.

Listing 13.6: datevalue.bas

Analysis: Line 3 includes the extended date and time functions. Line 5 creates a 
double DateSerial variable that will contain the converted value. Line 6 defines a string 
that will hold the date string value. Line 9 initializes the string variable to a date format, 
using the US regional settings. This may have to be changed on your computer if you are 
using a different setting. Line 11 creates a DateSerial from the string value. Line 13 prints 
the value using the Format function.

When you run the program you should see the following output.

Date&nbsp;string&nbsp;is&nbsp;08/15/2006
Output 13.7: Output of datevalue.bas

If you run this program and get a strange date, then the regional settings on your 
computer are different than what is shown in this program. For example, if your setting 
has the year first, then you will need to change the string format to have the year first in 
the string, rather than last. The DateValue function, used in conjunction with the IsDate 
function which is covered later in this chapter, is an easy way to get a date from the user 
which then can be used for date calculations.
Day Function
The Day function will return the day number from a DateSerial. The Day function 
takes a single date serial value and returns an integer representing the day number.

int_value&nbsp;=&nbsp;Day(date_serial)

1. DateSerial: The date serial value.
2. Return: Integer value representing the day of the month.

The Day function returns the same value as DatePart with the day interval 
specified.
Hour Function
The Hour function returns the current hour number from a TimeSerial value. The 
Hour function takes a single TimeSerial value, or a DateSerial value with a time 
component and returns an integer that represents the hour.

186


int_value&nbsp;=&nbsp;Hour(time_serial)

1. TimeSerial: The time serial value.
2. Return: Integer value representing the hour of the day. If the PM specifier is added 
to the time value, the hour number returned will be in 24 hour format. That is, 1:00 
PM will return 13.

string to a TimeSerial using the TimeValue function. Line 13 prints the hour number of the 
TimeSerial.

When you run the program you should see the following output.

Hour&nbsp;is&nbsp;13
Output 13.8: Output of hour.bas

     187


Minute Function
The Minute function returns the minute number from a TimeSerial value. The 
Minute function takes a single TimeSerial value, or a DateSerial with a time component, 
and returns an integer representing the minute.

int_value&nbsp;=&nbsp;Minute(time_serial)

1. TimeSerial: The time serial value.
2. Return: Integer value representing the minute of the hour. 
Month Function
The Month function returns the month number from a DateSerial value. The Month 
function takes a single DateSerial value and returns an integer representing the month.

int_value&nbsp;=&nbsp;Month(date_serial)

1. DateSerial: The date serial value.
2. Return: Integer value representing the month of the year. 
MonthName Function
The MonthName function returns a string representing the name of the month. The 
MonthName function takes an integer representing the month, and an optional flag that 
will return a month abbreviation if set.

string_value&nbsp;=&nbsp;MonthName(month_number)
string_value&nbsp;=&nbsp;MonthName(month_number,&nbsp;abbreviate)

1. Month Number: An integer representing the month.
2. Abbreviate: A flag that indicates whether to return an abbreviated month name. If 
flag is 0, the full month will be returned. If the flag is 1, the abbreviated month 
name will be returned.
3. Return: A string value representing the name of the month. The return value is 
based on the current locale settings of the system.

time with the abbreviate flag set to 1 to get month abbreviation.

When you run the program you should see output similar to the following, 
depending on your local settings.

Now Function
The Now function returns a double-type value representing the current system 
date and time. The Now function takes no parameters.

double_value&nbsp;=&nbsp;Now

1. Return: A double value representing the current system date and time.
Second Function
The Second function returns an integer value representing the second number of a 
TimeSerial value, or a DateSerial with a time component. The Second function takes a 
single TimeSerial value.

     189


int_value&nbsp;=&nbsp;Second(time_serial)

3. TimeSerial: The time serial value.
4. Return: Integer value representing the second of the minute. 
TimeSerial Function
The TimeSerial function will return a double-type TimeSerial value based on the 
passed hour, minute and secondy.  The time value returned by TimeSerial has no date 
component.

time_serial&nbsp;=&nbsp;TimeSerial(hour,&nbsp;minute,&nbsp;second)

1. Hour: The hour component of the time. The hour is passed in twenty-four format.
2. Minute: The minute component of the time.
3. Second: The second component of the the time.
4. Return: Returns a TimeSerial that is the value of the hour, minute and second 
components.

The TimeSerial function works just like the DateSerial function, except that it 
returns a time value rather than a date value. You can get both a date and time by 
adding a DateSerial value created with the DateSerial function to a TimeSerial value 
created with the TimeSerial function. Since the date is contained within the integer 
portion of the DateSerial and the time is contained within the fractional portion of the 
DateSerial, you can combine the two values by simply adding them. The following 
program illustrates this concept.

Listing 13.9: timedateserial.bas

Analysis: Line 3 includes the extended date and time functions. Line 5 creates 
three double-type values, ts which will be the time serial value, ds which will be the date 
serial value and cs, which will be the combined date and time serial value. Line 8 gets the 
date serial value using the DateSerial function. Line 10 gets the time serial value from 
the TimeSerial function. Line 12 adds the two values together to get a combined date and 
time serial value. Line 14 uses the Format function to print both the date and time. The 
AM/PM specifier is added to the time format string to convert the 24-hour value to a 12-
hour value.

When you run the program you should see the following output.

Date&nbsp;and&nbsp;time&nbsp;is&nbsp;01/10/2006&nbsp;01:10:42&nbsp;PM
Output 13.10: Output of timedateserial.bas
TimeValue Function
The time value function will return a TimeSerial value from a string representing 
the time value. The time string can contain either a 24-hour format such as “13:10:42” or 
a 12-hour format such as “01:10:42PM”.

time_serial&nbsp;=&nbsp;TimeValue(time_string)

1. Time String: A time string in either 24 or 12-hour formats.
2. Return: A TimeSerial representing the time string.
Year Function
The Year function returns an integer value representing the year number of a 
DateSerial value. The Year function takes a single DateSerial value.

int_value&nbsp;=&nbsp;Year(date_serial)

1. DateSerial: The date serial value.
2. Return: Integer value representing the year of the date serial value.
Weekday Function
The Weekday function returns the number of the day of the week. The Weekday 
function takes a DateSerial value and an optional flag that represents the first day of the 
week. 

int_value&nbsp;=&nbsp;Weekday(date_serial)
int_value&nbsp;=&nbsp;Weekday(date_serial,&nbsp;first_day_of_week)

     191


1. DateSerial: The date serial value.
2. First Day of Week: A flag that represents the day number that is regarded as the 
first day of the week. The values are the same as those in the DateDiff function.
3. Return: Integer value representing the day of the week.
WeekDayName Function
The WeekDayName function returns a string that is the name of the day. The 
WeekDayName function takes an integer representing the day of the week, an optional 
flag that indicates whether to return an abbreviated name and an option flag that 
indicates the first day of the week.

int_value&nbsp;=&nbsp;WeekDayName(day_number)
int_value&nbsp;=&nbsp;WeekDayName(day_number,&nbsp;abbreviate)
int_value&nbsp;=&nbsp;WeekDayName(day_number,&nbsp;abbreviate,&nbsp;first_day_of_week)

1. Day Number: The day number. The day number is interpreted by the first-day-of-
the-week setting.
2. Abbreviate: If this flag is 1, the function will return an abbreviated name, if 0 then 
the full name is returned.
3. First Day of Week: A flag that represents the day number that is regarded as the 
first day of the week. The values are the same as those in the DateDiff function.
4. Return: A string value that represents the name of the day of the week. The day 
name is based on the computer's locale setting.

The function works juts like the MonthName function with the added first-day-of-
the-week setting. 

A Look Ahead
Once you have created the data in your program, whether it be numeric, date or 
time data, you will at some point need to format that data. The Format function has all 
the capability you need to format these data types, and is the subject of the next 
chapter.

192


14 The Format Function
The Format function is a general purpose formatting function that can handle a 
wide range of numeric values. Once you understand the capabilities of the function, you 
will find yourself using this function for all your formatting routines. The Format function 
can handle simple numeric data, date and time values.

string_value&nbsp;=&nbsp;Format(numeric_value,&nbsp;format_string)

The numeric value parameter can any of the numeric values available in FreeBasic. 
The format string contains format characters that specify how to format the numeric 
value. If the Format string is an empty string, then Format behaves just like the Str 
function.
String Format Characters
You can display text within the format string using the general formatting string. 
The following table lists the string format characters.

Character Comment
: ? + $ () space Will return as a literal string.
\ Will return the next character in the string 
as a literal character.
“text” Will return text within double quotes as a 
literal string.
: Used as a separator for time components.
/ Used as a separator for date components.
Table 14.1: String Format Characters

The values listed in the table will return as literal text, and can be used to generate 
a string that contains both literal characters and formatted numeric text.
Numeric Format Characters
There are a number of format characters that can be used to format simple 
numeric types. The following table lists the format characters.

Character Comment
0 (zero) The zero is a digit placeholder. How the 
number is formatted depends on how many 
zeros are in the format string and how 
many numbers on either side of the 
     193


Character Comment
decimal point of the number. If there are 
fewer digits than 0's, a leading or trailing 
zero are added to the format string. If there 
are more digits to the right of the decimal 
than there are 0's, then the number is 
rounded. The number to the left of the 
decimal are not changed.
# This format character works in the same 
way as the 0 character, except the leading 
or trailing zeros are not displayed.
. (decimal point) Will return a decimal point within the 
formated string. If the format string only 
has #'s to the left of the decimal point, then 
numbers smaller than 1 will be displayed 
with only a leading decimal point. 
% Will multiply number by 100 and return 
percentage sign.
, (comma) The comma is used as the thousands 
separator. Two adjacent commas, or a 
comma right after the decimal point, will 
not display the thousands digits and will 
round the number.
E- E+ e- e+ These characters are used to format a 
string in scientific format. Placing a 0 or # 
to either the left or right of the character 
determines the number of digits to display 
on either side of the exponent sign. The 
negative characters are used to display 
negative exponents and the positive 
characters are used to display positive 
exponents.
Table 14.2: Numeric Format Characters

As you can see from the character table, there is a wide range of formatting 
options available for formatting numeric data. The following program demonstrates how 
to use some of the formatting options.

Listing 14.1: format-numeric.bas

Analysis: Line 3 includes the extended date and time function library which also 
includes the Format function. Line 5 creates a double value that will be used as the 
numeric value in the formatting expressions. Line 7 prints the unformatted value. Line 9 
prints the value as a currency value using the $ with commas used to separate the 
thousand places and two # characters after the decimal point to round the value. Line 10 
sets the double variable to .1 for different formatting. Line 11 prints the unformatted 
value. Line 12 prints the value in scientific format. Line 13 prints the value with leading 
and trailing zeros. Line 14 prints the value as a percentage.

When you run the program you should see the following output.

Date Format Characters
In the previous chapter you saw some of the date format characters used in the 
example programs. The following table lists all the date format Characters and their 
meaning.

Character Comment
d Returns the day of the month without 
leading zeros.
dd Returns the day of the month with leading 
zeros.
ddd Returns the day of the week name as an 
abbreviation.
     195

month and day values with a two-digit year. Line 10 prints the date with two-digit month 
and day values and a four-digit year. Line 11 prints the date with the year first. Line 12 
using a dash to separate the date components and line 13 uses a space to separate the 
date components.

When you run the program you should see the following.

Date&nbsp;Serial:&nbsp;8/16/2006
Date&nbsp;with&nbsp;single&nbsp;chars:&nbsp;16/8/06
Date&nbsp;with&nbsp;double&nbsp;chars:&nbsp;16/08/2006

Output 14.2: Output of format-date.bas
Time Format Characters
The time format characters are similar to the date format characters and are used 
in much the same way. The following table lists the format characters that you can use 
with a TimeSerial value.

Character Comment
h Returns the hour without a leading zero.
hh Returns the hour with a leading zero for 
single digit hour numbers.
m Returns the minute without a leading zero.
mm Returns the minute with a leading zero for 
single digit minute numbers.
s Returns the second without a leading zero.
ss Returns the second with a leading zero for 
single digit second numbers.
ttttt Returns a TimeSerial value formatted as the 
local specific time format.
AM/PM
am/pm

Converts the time to a 12-hour format and 
adds an am or pm to the return value.

A/P
a/p

Converts the time to a 12-hour format ans 
adds an a or p the return value.

Output 14.3: Output of format-time.bas

The Format function has a tremendous amount of functionality, and when working 
with numeric data, it is an invaluable resource in formatting. You should some time to 
become acquainted with this function as it will save you lot of time when you need to 
format your data.
A Look Ahead
At this point you should have a good understanding of the data types available in 
FreeBasic. Creating data is only half the story though. You need to display that data and 
you need to gather data from your user. The next chapter shows how to make your 
screen output look interesting and explains the various ways to gather user input.

15 Console Programming
Console programming, or more generally text-based programming, is a 
programming style that uses text as the primary medium to display information to, and 
to interact with, the user. This is in contrast to GUI programming, where a graphical user 
interface is used for display and interaction or a graphics-based program where graphical 
objects are used for display and interaction. Text-based programming has its roots in the 
early days of computing, when computers did not have graphical displays or the graphics 
were too primitive to be of use. Even today, in this era of photo-realistic graphics, text-
based programming remain a vibrant area of application development.
At first glance it may seem that text-based applications would be limited, however 
this is not the case at all. Over the years everything from sophisticated word processors 
and spreadsheets to games have been developed using only text. Text user interfaces, or 
TUIs have been developed that have all the functionality of modern graphical user 
interfaces. Many of the most popular games in history, such as Zork, were written 
entirely in text. Text-based application are content oriented, and if conveying content is 
what you are trying to do, then a text-based application is well suited to the task.

If you are interested in text-based programming you should visit Ascii World located at 
http://www.ascii-world.com. Ascii World is a site devoted entirely to text-based 
programming, regardless of the programming language.

The Console Screen
The console can be viewed as a grid, where each row contains a certain number 
columns. In FreeBasic you can specify how many rows and columns a console can 
contain, providing the operating system supports the configuration. The basic console 
configuration is 25 rows by 80 columns. Consoles are row oriented, so you specify a 
position on the grid using the row followed by the column Each grid location can contain 
a single character.
The character set for the console under Windows®, is the Ascii character set. The 
Ascii character set contains 256 characters and includes all the numbers, letters and 
punctuation you would expect, as well as some extended characters used in European 
languages, and a set graphical characters that can used for drawing lines and boxes on 
the screen. By using both text and the Ascii graphical characters in a console application 
you can create quite sophisticated user interfaces completely in text.
The Console Functions
FreeBasic has a number of console functions that enable you to position text on 
the screen, set the foreground and background colors of the text, and to retrieve 
information from the console screen. You can also use the mouse in the console for added 
functionality. The following table lists the console commands available in FreeBasic.

Function Syntax Comment
Cls Cls mode Clears the screen. If mode is 

200


Function Syntax Comment
0 or omitted, entire screen 
is cleared. If mode is 1 the 
graphics viewport is cleared. 
If mode is 2, the text 
viewport is cleared.
Color Color foreground, 
background
B = Color

Sets the foreground and/or 
background color of printed 
text.
Color can also be used to 
return the current color 
attributes, where the 
foreground color is the low-
word and the background 
color is the high-word.
Csrlin B = Csrlin Returns the row that the 
cursor currently occupies. 
Format B = Format (numeric, 
format_string)

Formats a numerical 
expression according to 
format_string.

Getmouse Getmouse col, row, wheel, 
button

Returns the current position 
of the mouse cursor in row, 
col, the current wheel state 
and button state.

Locate Locate row, column, 
cursor_state

Positions the cursor on the 
row and column. If 
cursor_state is 0, cursor is 
hidden. If 1, cursor is shown.
Pos B = Pos Returns the current column 
of the cursor.
Print
?

Print expression
Print expression,
Print expression;
? expression
? expression,
? expression;

Prints expression to the 
screen. Expression can be 
text, a string variable or 
numeric variable. A comma 
at the end of the print string 
will print a tab space with 
no carriage return. A semi-
colon will not print a 
carriage return. If no comma 
or semi-colon, a carriage 
return is printed.

Print Using Print Using format_string, 
expression1
Print Using format_string, 
expression1,
Print Using format_string, 
expression1;

Print expression to the 
screen using a format string. 
Print Using has some known 
bugs and should not be 
used. Use format instead.

     201


Function Syntax Comment
Screen B = Screen(row, col, 
color_flag)

Screen returns the ascii 
character code at row and 
column position if color_flag 
is 0. If color_flag is 1, Screen 
returns the color attribute.
You can determine the 
background color with 
background&nbsp;=&nbsp;attribute&nbsp;
shr&nbsp;4 and the foreground 
color with foreground&nbsp;=&nbsp;
attribute&nbsp;and&nbsp;&amp;hf.
Spc Spc columns Causes next print statement 
to skip number of columns.
Tab Tab column Sets column for next print 
statement.
View Print View Print first_row To 
last_row

Sets printing area of screen.

Width Width columns, rows Sets the the number of 
columns and rows of the 
console window.
Table 15.1: Console Commands
Console Colors
The default color scheme for the console is white text on a black background. You 
can change the color scheme by using the Color function to change either or both the 
foreground and background color of printed text. For the console, the color numbers 
range from 0, black, to 15, bright white. The following list enumerates the color numbers 
that can be used in the console.

? 0: black
? 1: blue
? 2: green
? 3: cyan
? 4: red
? 5: magenta
? 6: yellow
? 7: white
? 8: gray
? 9: bright blue
? 10: bright green
? 11: bright cyan

202


? 12: bright red
? 13: bright magenta
? 14: bright yellow
? 15: bright white

The colors listed above may vary, depending on your graphics card and monitor, 
but they should approximate those listed. In addition to printing colored text, you can 
also set the background of the entire console screen by setting the background color 
using the Color function, and then using Cls to clear the screen. When the screen is 
cleared, the background will be in the selected color.

Color is useful for enhancing the look of your application, but you should never rely on 
color alone to indicate critical information in your application. Approximately 15 million 
people are color blind just in the United States. Depending on the level of color 
blindness, an individual may miss critical information if it is displayed using color alone. 
It is good practice to identify critical information through the use of text manipulation, 
such as a pop-up box, so that the information won't be missed by a color blind user.

Each character position on the console screen stores the character value, along 
with the current color attributes which can be determined using the Screen function. If 
color_flag is 0, Screen will return the ascii code of the character at the selected row and 
column. If color_flag is 1, Screen will return the color attribute. Colors are stored as byte 
values with the high 4 bits indicate the background color and the low 4 bits indicate the 
foreground color, the color of the text. You can determine the color attributes by using 
the following formulas.

Foreground&nbsp;=&nbsp;attribute&nbsp;And&nbsp;15
Background&nbsp;=&nbsp;attribute&nbsp;&nbsp;Shr&nbsp;4

Listing 15.1: color.bas

Analysis: Line 3 dimensions  the working variables, clr which contains the color 
attribute of a text position and ccode which is the character code. Line 6 sets the current 
color to bright white, 15, with a black background, 0. Line 9 stores the current clr setting 
in the variable clr. Lines 13 and 14 print the current color numbers to the screen using 
the Loword and Hiword macros. Line 17 stores the character code at row position 1, 
column position 1 in ccode. Line 18 prints both the character code and the corresponding 
character to the screen. Line 21 retrieves the color attribute for the same position, and 
lines 22 and 23 print the color values using the formula listed above. The program is 
closed in the usual way.

When you run the program you should see the following output.

Current&nbsp;color&nbsp;setting:
Foreground:&nbsp;15
Background:&nbsp;0

Character&nbsp;code&nbsp;at&nbsp;1,1&nbsp;is&nbsp;67&nbsp;which&nbsp;is&nbsp;C.
Foreground&nbsp;color&nbsp;at&nbsp;1,1:&nbsp;15
Background&nbsp;color&nbsp;at&nbsp;1,1:&nbsp;0
Output 15.1: Output of color.bas

The display will be in bright white, with a black background. As you can see, you 
have tremendous control over the appearance of console text and can easily determine 
the attributes of the text.
Positioning Text
You can position text anywhere on the console screen using the Locate statement. 
The Locate statement sets the text cursor position for subsequent printing of text. To 
204


print to a certain location on the screen, you must first position the text cursor using the 
locate statement, then follow that command with a print statement. You can turn the text 
cursor on and off by using the optional cursor flag of the locate statement. 1 turns the 
text cursor on, and 0 turns the cursor off. This is useful if, for example, you are using the 
mouse for console input.
The Print command will update the current cursor position.  You can obtain the 
current row setting by using the Csrlin function and the current column setting by using 
the Pos function. 
Printing Text
The Print statement is used to print text to the screen. The location and color of 
the text is determined by the current cursor setting and the last color statement. Using 
the Print statement with a semi-colon after the print string will position the text cursor to 
the end of the string. Using a comma after the print string will position the text cursor to 
the next tab location. A Print statement without either a semi-colon or comma, will insert 
a carriage return and/or line feed positioning the cursor at the beginning of the next line.
You can format the output of numeric text using the Print Using command, 
although this is a deprecated function and has some known, minor bugs. The function is 
available mainly for backward compatibility with older programs.  For new programs, you 
should use the Format function, which is covered in a separate chapter later in this book. 
For details on the Print Using function see the FreeBasic documentation wiki4. The 
function will not be covered in this book.
You have already seen the Spc and Tab functions in several of the example 
programs. The Spc function will cause the next print position to skip a number of columns 
while the Tab function will put the text cursor at the next tab position. Both of these 
functions are useful for printing tabular data to the screen.
Determining and Setting the Size of the Console
You can determine the current console size, or set the number of rows and columns 
of the console by using the Width function. To determine the current console size, use the 
Width function without any parameters as shown in the following code snippet.

MyInt&nbsp;=&nbsp;Width
columns&nbsp;=&nbsp;Loword(myInt)
rows&nbsp;=&nbsp;Hiword(myInt)

The number of columns of the console is stored in the low word of the return 
integer value while the number of rows is stored in the high word of the integer. To set 
the console size, use the Width function with the number of desired columns and rows, as 
illustrated in the following code snippet.

Width&nbsp;80,&nbsp;25

This will set the console to 80 columns by 25 rows. The standard console 
configuration is 80 columns by 25 rows, however, if you need a different size for your 
4At the time of this writing, the Print Using wiki page is loacted at 
http://www.freebasic.net/wiki/wikka.php?wakka=KeyPgPrintusing.
     205


application you can use the Width function to check if the console is the appropriate size 
and then resize if necessary. Setting the console size will reset the cursor position to row 
1 and column 1, so you may need to issue a Locate statement to reset the cursor position 
after the change.
The following program shows how to use the Width function to get the consile size 
information and reset the console.

End
Listing 15.2: width.bas

Analysis: Line 3 dimensions three variables, consize that will contain the Width 
return value, rows which will contain the number of rows and cols which will contain the 
number of columns. Line 6 gets the current console size. Line 7 retrieves the number of 
rows using the Hiword macro and line 8 retrieves the number of columns using the 
Loword macro. The current setting is printed to the screen in lines 9 and 10. The Sleep 
command is used in line 12 to pause the program and wait for a key press from the user. 
Line 13 clears the screen.

206


Lines 16 through 18 check to see if the number of rows is greater than 15 and if 
true, then resets the console to 80 columns by 25 rows. Line 21 checks the new console 
size and the current rows and columns are retrieved in lines 22 and 23. The new values 
are printed in lines 24 and 25. The program is then closed in the usual way.

When you run the program you should see output similar to the following.

Current&nbsp;Rows&nbsp;=&nbsp;25
Current&nbsp;Columns&nbsp;=&nbsp;80
Press&nbsp;any&nbsp;key...
Output 15.2: Output a of width.bas

New&nbsp;Rows&nbsp;=&nbsp;25
New&nbsp;Columns&nbsp;=&nbsp;80
Output 15.3: Output b of width.bas

Output a shows the console setting when the program starts, and Output b shows 
the console setting after checking the console size. In this run the default setting was the 
desired size, so the Width statement did not need to be executed.
Getting User Input
If you need to interact with the user, then you will need to get user input. There 
are several ways to collect user input which are listed in the following table.

Function Syntax Comment
Inkey B = Inkey Returns a key from the 
keyboard buffer as a string. 
If an extended key is 
pressed, the return string 
contains character 255 + 
key character. Inkey does 
not wait for keyboard input.
Input Input variable_list
Input “prompt”; variable_list
Input “prompt”,variable_list

Input will gather input for 
one or more variables listed 
in variable_list. The 
variables should be 
separated with commas. 
The type of variable 
determines how input will 
collect the data. If the data 
type of the variable is a 
string, Input will convert the 
input data to a string. If the 
data type of the variable is 
     207


numeric, Input will convert 
the data to a number. If an 
invalid numeric string is 
entered, Input will attempt 
to convert as many 
characters as possible to a 
number. If no characters can 
be converted to a string, 
Input will return 0. If a semi-
colon is used with Input, a 
question mark will be 
displayed after the prompt. 
If a comma is used, a 
question mark will not be 
printed.

Input() B = 
Input(number_of_characters
)

Input() will return a string 
containing number of 
characters entered. 
Getkey B = GetKey Returns the ascii code of the 
current key in the keyboard 
buffer. Getkey will wait for a 
key. If an extended key is 
pressed, the first character 
is skipped, character 255, 
and the second character is 
returned.
Line Input Line Input string_variable
B = Line Input “prompt”; 
string_variable
B = Line Input “prompt”, 
string_variable

Line Input will return a line 
of text from the keyboard. 
All characters up to, but not 
including the enter key are 
read. An optional prompt 
can be displayed with either 
a question mark, using a 
semi-colon, or no question 
mark when using a comma.

Winput() B = 
Winput(number_of_characte
rs)

Wide string version if 
Input().

Table 15.2: Input Functions
Inkey
Inkey is useful for polling the keyboard buffer in a loop and can be used in games 
or in text-based user interfaces since Inkey does not with for a key to be pressed. This 
allows you to process other events within your program, and then take action if a key has 
been pressed. If the buffer is empty, Inkey will return an empty string. If a key is waiting 
in the buffer, Inkey will return a string that is either one or two character long. Keys can 
be either the normal printable keys, such as A or 1, or an extended key such as the Up 
Arrow or F1. Normal keys return 1 key code, while the extended keys return 2 key codes, 
with the first code being character 255.

Listing 15.3: inkey.bas

Analysis: Line 3 dimensions two string variables, key which will be the return value 
from Inkey and char which will be the individual characters. The integer variable i in line 
4 will be used in the For-Next to extract the individual characters fro the key variable. 
Line 6 through 23 define a keyboard processing loop using. Line 8 checks for keyboard 
input. Line 10 checks to see if the length of key is greater than zero, indicating that Inkey 
returned a key. Lines 12 through 15 clear the previous output line that may have been 
printed. Lines 17 through 20 extract each character from the key variable, loading the 
actual character into the variable char in line 18 and then printing the corresponding ascii 
code to the screen in line 19. 
The Sleep command is used in line 22 to allow the operating system to process 
other events. If you are using an extended loop such as this keyboard input loop, you 
should always insert a Sleep # command in the loop to allow the operating system to 
process background tasks, otherwise your program may consume 100 percent of the 
operating system's time. 

     209


Line 23 then checks to see if the escape key was pressed, which is ascii code 27, 
and then exits the loop if the key was pressed. The program is then closed using the end 
statement.

A sample output is shown below.

The output shows the codes when the F1 key is pressed. Once you know the key 
codes, then you can build Const statements to trap for certain keys. For example, to trap 
for the F1 key, you would create the Const statement shown in the code snippet below.

Const&nbsp;F1_key&nbsp;=&nbsp;Chr(255)&nbsp;&amp;&nbsp;Chr(59)
You can then check the Inkey return to see if the key returned natches the F1 key.

If&nbsp;key&nbsp;=&nbsp;key_F1&nbsp;Then
'Then&nbsp;do&nbsp;something
End&nbsp;If

You can set up any number of keys in this manner. The F1 key is usually used to 
display help content, and in your application you could display a help screen by executing 
the help display code in the body of the If statement. If you are coding a game, you might 
want to use the arrow keys to move your character player around the screen, by setting 
up the arrow key constants and then adding a If-Then-Elseif ladder to process the arrows 
keys.
Getkey
Unlike Inkey, Getkey does wait for the user to press a key. If an extended key is 
pressed, Getkey will discard the first character and return the second character. Getkey is 
used in situations where you are not interested in the extended key set and you need to 
pause the program to gather user input. 
Input
The Input function is used to gather information from the user that will be loaded 
into one or more variables. The data type of the variable determines how the user input 
is processed. If the variable is a string, Input will process the information as a string; if 
the variable is a numeric data type, Input will try to convert the information to a number. 
The variables must be separated using commas.
You can display a prompt string with Input by enclosing a literal string before the 
variable list. If a semi-colon is used after prompt string, a question will be displayed after 
the prompt. If a comma is used after the prompt string, no question mark is printed.
If you are supplying multiple variables to Input, then the user will need to enter the 
values separated by either spaces or commas. The spaces and commas are not returned 
210


by Input. If you need to process either spaces or commas, then you need to use Line 
Input rather than Input.
Line Input
Line Input will return a single string up to but not including the enter key. That is, 
Line Input expects a single string variable, rather than multiple variables. Line Input will 
read both spaces and commas in the entered string. Like Input, you can use a semi-colon 
to display a question mark at the end of the prompt string. Unlike Input however, you can 
use either a literal string or a string variable for the prompt. Line Input returns the user 
input as a string and does not convert numeric strings to numbers.
Using the Mouse
Another way to get user input is to use the mouse. The Getmouse function will 
return the current zero-based row and column of the mouse as well as the state of the 
buttons and mouse wheel. Since the rows and columns are zero-based, you will need to 
add 1 to the values to map the return values to the screen
The current state of the mouse wheel as an integer that starts at zero when the 
program starts and will return either a more positive number if the mouse wheel is turned 
in a forward direction and a more negative number if the mouse wheel is turned in the 
reverse direction. Normally, you would store the mouse wheel value at program start, 
and then take an action based on the offset value returned by Getmouse. For example, to 
scroll some text, you may scroll up if the wheel number is moving in the positive direction 
and scroll down if the wheel number is moving in the negative direction.
You can also determine which buttons have been pressed by checking the button 
return value. Getmouse supports three buttons, left and right and a middle button, which 
often doubles as the mouse wheel. You can determine which button has been pressed by 
using the following formulas.

? Left button = button And 1 
? Right button = button And 2 
? Middle button = button And 4

Button is the value returned by the Getmouse function. Not only can you check for 
single button presses, but you can also check to see if both button have been pressed by 
checking each button state simultaneously. There is no way to check for a double click 
natively however, so you will need to create your own timing code to determine if a 
button has been double-clicked.
The following program illustrates using the Getmouse functions.

Listing 15.4: con-mouse.bas

Analysis: Line 4 creates the mouse parameter working variables. Mx and my are 
the current column and row returned by the Getmouse function. Oldmx and oldmy are 
the old column and row settings that are used to erase the mouse cursor character that is 
displayed on the screen. Mwheel is the current mouse wheel setting while mbuttons is 
the current button state. Line 7 uses the Locate statement to turn off the text cursor. Line 
8 through 35 are the mouse input loop that polls the mouse. Line 10 uses the Getmouse 
function to return the current mouse state information. Since Getmouse returns the row 
and column as a zero-based value, lines 12 and 13 add 1 to the value to map the return 
value to the actual screen coordinates. Line 15 checks to see if the mouse is still within 
the console screen. If the mouse is outside the console screen, Getmouse will return -1 
for the row and column values. Since the program added 1 to these values, if the mouse 
212


is outside the console window, the mx and my values will be 0; that is, -1 + 1 = 0. You 
should always check to make sure the mouse is still inside the console window before 
interacting with the mouse.
Lines 16 and 18 prints the current row, column and wheel settings to the console 
screen. Lines 20 through 22 check to see what mouse button, if any, has been pressed 
and prints the mouse button id to the screen. L is the left mouse button, R is the right 
mouse button and M is the middle button. Lines 25 and 26 erase the old mouse location 
indicator, an asterisk that will follow the mouse cursor on the screen. Lines 28 and 29 
then print the asterisk at the new mouse location. Lines 31 and 32 save the current mx 
and my values in oldmx and oldmy, to use in the next loop iteration.
The Do-Loop is exited in line 35 when any key is pressed. Line 27 turned the text 
cursor back on and the program is closed with the End statement in line 39.

When you run the program you should see something similar to the following.

Row:&nbsp;2&nbsp;Col:&nbsp;4&nbsp;W:&nbsp;2&nbsp;BT:L

If the mouse does not work in the console window, then you will need to turn off 
the Quick Edit mode of the console. Right click the title bar and select Properties. Under 
Edit Options, uncheck the QuickEdit mode. If a pop-up window appears, select Save 
Properties for Future Windows with Same Title, then click the OK button. The mouse 
should not work in the console window.
Creating a Text View Port
You can create a text view port using the View Print statement. A text view port 
can be thought of as a window -within-a-window, where all text operations occur. You 
define a view by passing the beginning row and ending row to the View Print command. 
Once the command has been issued, all subsequent text operations occur within the view 
port.
The following program creates a 10 line view port and prints some text within the 
view, which can be scrolled using the mouse wheel. If the mouse does not work within 
the console window,  you will need to turn off the QuickEdit mode as described above.

Listing 15.5: view-print.bas

Analysis: Line 4 creates a single-dimension array that initialized to some random 
text. The text will be printed in the view port created later in the program. Line 25 and 26 
creates the working variables. Idx is the current line index into the myText array. Mx and 
my are the mouse column and rows, which are not used in the program, but are needed 
for the Getmouse function. Oldwheel and mwheel are the last and current wheel position 
variables. Delta is the difference between the old wheel position and the current wheel 
position. Delta is used to calculate the offset for the idx variable. Line 26 dimensions two 
variables,  vtop and vbot which are the top and bottom of the view port.
Line 28 through 40 define the PrintText subroutine which will print the array text to 
the view port. The tidx parameter, is the current value contained within the idx variable, 
and points to the current line position in the text array. Line 29 creates two variables, i 
which is used in the following For-Next block and tbot which is used to calculate how 
many rows of text to print. Line 32 and 33 clear the view port. Line 35 calculates the 
number of lines to display. Tidx contains the start line in the text array, and tbot contains 
the end line in the text array. Line 36 checks to make sure that the end line contained 
within tbot does not point past the end of the array. Line 37 through 39 print the text to 
the view port. Since the view port is 10 lines, the code prints a 10 line “window” from the 
array to the view port.
Line 43 sets the width of the console, and lines 45 through 48 clear the main 
console window to a blue color. At the point the view port has not be created so these 
commands apply to the console widow as a whole. Line 505 creates a view port that 
     215


starts at vtop and extends to vbot, inclusive. All text commands issued after the View 
Print command will go now to the view port. Line 52 prints the initial 10 lines of text. Line 
54 gets the initial value of the mouse wheel, for use later to calculate the delta value.
Line 55 through 71 define the mouse input loop. Line 57 gets the current mouse 
wheel value. Line 58 checks to see if the new value is different than the old value, and if 
they are different, this means the mouse wheel has been moved.  Line 60 calculates the 
delta, or changed value, between the old mouse wheel setting and the new mouse wheel 
settings. Using this technique, you can calculate how to scroll the text, because the value 
will be either positive or negative depending on whether the mouse wheel is moved 
forward or backward.
Line 62 uses the delta value, to update the idx variable, which is the pointer to the 
current top line in the text array. If delta is positive, idx will move toward the end of the 
array, which means that the text will scroll up. If delta is negative, idx will move toward 
the beginning of the array, so the text will scroll down. Line 64 and 65 make sure that idx 
does not point past the beginning and end of the array. The current text block is then 
printed in line 67. Line 69 then saves the current wheel value in the oldwheel variable, to 
be used in the next delta calculation.
If a key pressed the loop is exited in line 72 and then program is closed with an 
End statement.

When you run the program you should see output similar to that shown below.

Output 15.6: Output of view-print.bas

When you run the program you will see a blue screen with a black view port in the 
middle with some text. Scroll the mouse wheel, and the text will scroll. Move the mouse 
wheel forward and the text will scroll down, move the mouse backward and the text will 
scroll up. The text will stop scrolling when the beginning or the end of the text is reached. 
As you can see, using the view port command along with the Getmouse function is a 
simple way to add a great deal of functionality to your text-based programs.
A Look Ahead
Now that you can create variables and gather input, you need to see how to build 
control structures to act on this data. In the next chapter you will see the various control 
structures that are available in FreeBasic.

     217


16Control Structures
Controls structures allow you to change the flow of your program, to execute 
different parts of your program based on certain criteria and to iterate through code 
blocks. Control structures fall into two categories; decision-making structures such as the 
If and Select Case statements, and looping structures such as the For-Next and Do-Loop 
statements. 
The decision-making, or branching structures, allow you define criteria based on 
data values, and then execute code based on those data values. If a variable is less than 
5, you can execute one code block, and if the variable is greater than 5, you can execute 
a different code block, and if the variable is equal to 5, you can execute yet another code 
block. Being able to make decisions within your program is crucial for implementing the 
logic that your program describes. 
The looping structures are also necessary elements to any program, since you will 
often need to process groups of information in a loop, such as reading a disk file or 
getting input from the user. Data manipulation almost always involves looping, since you 
will need to iterate through data structures to gather specific information that you will 
need in your program.  FreeBasic has a rich set of both decision-making and looping 
structures.
A Program is a State Machine
You can think of a program as a state machine, where at any given moment, the 
program is in a particular state, or condition, which changes over time. This may sound a 
bit cryptic, so an example may help illustrate what this means. Suppose it is getting close 
to evening and you realize that you are getting hungry. Call this the hungry state. Your 
stomach is empty, and your brain is telling you to get some food. You run down to the 
local hamburger joint, get a nice juicy double cheeseburger and consume it. You are now 
full, so call this the satisfied state. This is basically how a state machine operates. At one 
moment, your stomach is empty and the state is hungry and at the next moment, your 
stomach is full and the state is satisfied. You started in one state (hungry), executed a 
branching action (drove to the burger joint) and ended in another state (satisfied). 
Programs do much the same thing.
A variable is like your stomach. If the variable is empty, the program is in the 
empty state; that is, there is no meaningful data within the variable, so the program 
cannot do any meaningful work with that data. Programs are designed to do something, 
so you need to transition from the empty state to the satisfied state, by executing a 
branching statement (driving down to the burger joint) in order to initialize the variable 
with data. Once the variable is initialized (you ate the hamburger) the program changes 
state and now you can do something meaningful, since you now have meaningful data.
Control structures are the transition mechanisms that enable you to change the 
state of your program. If you are writing a game, you can use a Do-Loop to wait on user 
input. Once the user presses a key, you can then use an If or Select Case statement block 
to act on this key press. The program moves from a waiting state, to an action state, and 
then back to a waiting state, until another key is pressed or the program terminates. To 
effectively use control structures within your program, you must keep in mind the various 
states of your program, both before and after state transitions.

218


The If Statement Block
You can think of the If statement block as a question that requires a True or False 
answer. The answer determines which section of code your program will execute. Since 
computers only work with numbers, you frame the question as a conditional equation 
that will result in either 0 for False or non-zero for True. The following table lists the 
conditional operators that you can use within an If statement.

Operator Syntax Comment
Equal If var = 5 Then If operand on both sides of

execute code after Then

execute code after Then.
Greater Than or Equal If var &gt;= 5 Then If first operand is greater 
than or equal to second

following Then.
Table 16.1: Logical Operators

You can mix arithmetic, logical and conditional operators, as well as parenthesis, 
within an If statement. The compiler evaluates the conditional statements from left to 
right, taking into account the precedence of the operators.  For example, all of the 
following code snippets are legal If statement constructs.

If&nbsp;var1&nbsp;=&nbsp;5&nbsp;Then
If&nbsp;(var1&nbsp;=&nbsp;5)&nbsp;And&nbsp;(var2&nbsp;&lt;&nbsp;3)&nbsp;Then
If&nbsp;var1&nbsp;+&nbsp;6&nbsp;&gt;&nbsp;10&nbsp;Then

All of these conditional expressions are valid constructs, and if they evaluate to 
True, or non-zero, then the code following the Then clause will be executed. 

     219


Using Bitwise Operators in an If Statement
Remember that the operators And, Or and Not are bitwise operators. That is, they 
return a value based on the bitwise operation that they perform. You should take care 
when using bitwise operators within an If statement to make sure that the result will 
evaluate correctly. Take the second code snippet listed above. If var1 = 5, the compiler 
will return True, or -1 for the expression. If var2 is less than 3 then the compiler will return 
True or -1 for this expression. The compiler will then evaluate the And operator with -1 
And -1 returning -1. Since -1 is non-zero, or True, the code following the Then will be 
executed. If either of the statements within the parenthesis evaluate to 0, then And will 
return 0, which is False, and the code following the Then clause will be skipped. When 
using bitwise operators you should frame the conditional expressions on either side of 
the bitwise operator so that they return either True or False. This will give you consistent 
results in your evaluations.
The Not Problem
The Not bitwise operator can be a problem in an If statement. You may be used to 
writing If&nbsp;Not&nbsp;var&nbsp;Then, with Not performing a logical, rather than a bitwise operation. 
In FreeBasic Not performs a bitwise operation, not a logical operation. If var were to 
contain the value of 3, then Not 3 is -4, which will be regarded as a True result and the 
code following the Then will be executed, which is probably not what you wanted. Instead 
of writing If&nbsp;Not&nbsp;var&nbsp;Then, you should write If&nbsp;var&nbsp;&lt;&gt;&nbsp;0&nbsp;Then.
The Single-Line If Statement
The basic form of the If statement will execute a single statement if the conditional 
expression evaluates to True.

If&nbsp;&lt;expression&gt;&nbsp;Then&nbsp;&lt;statement&gt;:&lt;statement&gt;...

In this form, &lt;expression&gt; can be a single or compound expression and 
&lt;statement&gt; can be more than one statement separated with : or colons. The following 
program demonstrates the syntax of the single-line If.

Sleep
End
Listing 16.1: if-single.bas

220


Analysis: Line 3 creates an integer value and initializes the variable to 1. Line 5 
uses a single-line If to evaluate the variable. Since myInt is one, which evaluates to True, 
the compound statement following the Then clause if executed.  In line 8, myInt is set to 
0. The If statement in line 9 evaluates the variable, which is now 0 or False, so the 
compound statement following the Then clause is not executed.

When you run the program you should see the following output.

This&nbsp;is&nbsp;the&nbsp;first&nbsp;statement.
This&nbsp;is&nbsp;the&nbsp;second&nbsp;statement.
Output 16.1: Output of if_single.bas

You will notice that there is only one set of print lines in the output, since the 
second If evaluated to False and the print statements were never executed.
The If Code Block
A better way to group multiple statements within an If  is to use the If-End If code 
block. By separating the statements inside a code block, it is much easier to read and to 
debug if necessary.

If&nbsp;&lt;expression&gt;&nbsp;Then&nbsp;
&lt;statement&gt;
&lt;statement&gt;
...
End&nbsp;If

The block If statement operates in the same manner as the single-line If. If 
&lt;expression&gt; evaluates to True, then the statements between the If and End If are 
executed.
Nested If Statements
At times it may become necessary to nest If statements in order to better describe 
the decision making process of the evaluation. While the If statement can handle multiple 
arguments within an expression, there are times when  you may want to incrementally 
check for certain ranges of values which you can do using a nested If block.

If&nbsp;&lt;expression&gt;&nbsp;Then&nbsp;
&lt;statement&gt;
...
If&nbsp;&lt;expression&gt;&nbsp;Then
&lt;statement&gt;
&lt;statement&gt;
...

     221


End&nbsp;If

End&nbsp;If

It is important to close each block properly when opened by an If to avoid compiler 
or logical errors. Compiler errors are fairly easy to fix, while logical errors can be tricky to 
track down and correct. The best way to make sure you are closing the blocks properly is 
to indent the nested If statements and then indent the matching End If statements at the 
same level. In the example above, the indentation tells you at a glance which End If goes 
with which If. 
The Else Statement
When an If expression evaluates to True, the statements following the Then will 
execute. If the expression evaluates to False, then the statements following the If will 
execute. However, there are times when you will want to execute a different set of 
instructions if the If evaluates to False, rather than just continuing on with the program. 
The Else statement allows you code one or more statements to handle the False case of 
an If evaluation.

If&nbsp;&lt;expression&gt;&nbsp;Then&nbsp;
&lt;statement&gt;
&lt;statement&gt;
...
Else
&lt;statement&gt;
&lt;statement&gt;
...
End&nbsp;If

The If-Else-End If construct allows you to handle both the True and False cases of 
an If evaluation. One example of using this format is when you try to open a file. If the 
Open succeeds, then you can process the file in the statements following the Then 
clause. If the Open fails, you can display an error message to the user in the Else block, 
set a flag that indicates the file could not be opened or End the program at this point. 
How you handle the exception depends on the needs of your program, but the Else 
statement allows you handle these types of program exceptions.
The ElseIf Statement
The ElseIf statement enables you to create an “If Ladder” construct, where you can 
test a series of conditions much like the rungs of a ladder. FreeBasic will evaluate the 
expressions in order, from top to bottom, and then execute the first series of statements 
that evaluate to True, skipping the rest of the ElseIf tests. Elseif can be used in 
conjunction with a final Else statement to execute a default set of statements if none of 
the expressions in the ladder evaluate to True.

If&nbsp;&lt;expression&gt;&nbsp;Then&nbsp;
&lt;statement&gt;
&lt;statement&gt;

222


...
ElseIf&nbsp;&lt;expression&gt;&nbsp;Then
&lt;statement&gt;
&lt;statement&gt;
...
Else
&lt;statement&gt;
&lt;statement&gt;
...
End&nbsp;If

You start the block with a standard If statement, then add any additional ElseIf 
statements as necessary, and optionally, as in the example, you can add an Else 
statement as a default handler. The order of an If-ElseIf block can be important. The 
compiler will evaluate the first If statement, and if the expression is False, it will then drop 
down to the next ElseIf and evaluate that expression, and continue on down the ladder 
until an End If or Else is encountered. If your expressions are range values or compound 
statements then you need to make sure that the expression ranges don't overlap 
otherwise you may execute the wrong set of Then statements. The following program 
shows an example of using the ElseIf statement.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;End&nbsp;If
Next

Sleep
End
Listing 16.2: elseif.bas

Analysis: Line 3 initializes the random number generator with the Timer statement. 
Line 5 creates two integer variables, myNumber which will hold a random integer 
     223


between 1 and 10 and i, which will be used in the For-Next statement. Line 7 opens the 
For-Next block which will execute the code between the For and Next 10 times. Line 8 
uses the Rnd function to generate a random number in the rand 1 to 9. Since Rnd returns 
a double precision number, the Int function is used to convert the value to an integer. 
Line 10 through 16 define the If ladder. Line 10 checks to see if the random number is 
between 1 and 3; that is, if the number is 1 it will be greater than 0 and less than 4. 
Using &gt; and &lt; in this manner defines a range of values to test. Line 12 uses an ElseIf to 
test for the next range of values between 4 and 7 inclusive. Line 14 defines the default 
code handler using an Else statement. If the If and ElseIf evaluate to False, then the Else 
statement will execute. Line 17 closes the For-Next block.

When you run the program you should see output similar to the following.

Number&nbsp;is&nbsp;between&nbsp;1&nbsp;and&nbsp;3:&nbsp;3
Number&nbsp;is&nbsp;between&nbsp;4&nbsp;and&nbsp;7:&nbsp;7
Number&nbsp;is&nbsp;between&nbsp;1&nbsp;and&nbsp;3:&nbsp;1
Number&nbsp;is&nbsp;between&nbsp;4&nbsp;and&nbsp;7:&nbsp;5
Number&nbsp;is&nbsp;between&nbsp;1&nbsp;and&nbsp;3:&nbsp;2
Number&nbsp;is&nbsp;between&nbsp;4&nbsp;and&nbsp;7:&nbsp;7
Number&nbsp;is&nbsp;between&nbsp;4&nbsp;and&nbsp;7:&nbsp;4
Number&nbsp;is&nbsp;greater&nbsp;than&nbsp;7:&nbsp;10
Number&nbsp;is&nbsp;greater&nbsp;than&nbsp;7:&nbsp;9
Number&nbsp;is&nbsp;between&nbsp;4&nbsp;and&nbsp;7:&nbsp;6
Output 16.2: Output of elseif.bas

This example program is a case where you must be careful not to overlap the 
range values, otherwise you will get results you did not expect. Using the &gt; and &lt; 
operators create a range that is 1 more than the second operand of &gt; and 1 less than the 
second operand of &lt;. If you were to incorrectly overlap the 4 value for example, then the 
ElseIf statement would execute for a value of 4, which is not the intention of the program.
The IIF Function 
The Iif, or “immediate If” function returns one of two numeric values based on an 
expression. You can think if the Iif function as an in-line If statement that acts as a 
function call.

Value&nbsp;=&nbsp;Iif(&lt;expression&gt;,&nbsp;numeric_value_if_true,&nbsp;numeric_value_if_false)

Iif can be as a standalone function or inside other expressions where you do not 
want to split the expression to insert an If statement. The numeric values can be literal 
values, variables or numeric function calls. The limitation of the function is that it will only 
return a numeric value, not a string value, however you can work around this limitation 
by using pointers. 

224


Unlike the Visual Basic version of this function, FreeBasic does evaluate both of the 
return statements.

Sleep
End
Listing 16.3: iif.bas

Analysis: Lines 3 thorough 5 define the constant values that will be used in the 
program. False is defined as 0, and True is defined as Not False which will evaluate to -1. 
Null is defined as 0, which will be used as a check for the pointer variable declared later 
in the program. Lines 7 and 8 create the working variables for the program. The iresult 
variable is used as the return value for the Iif function, while the rest of the variables are 
used as expression and return variables. The pointer variable  myZString, is used as the 
return value from the function GetString.
Lines 10 through 13 and 15 through 18 define two functions that will be used for 
the True and False return values of the Iif function. Each function prints a string to the 
screen to indicate that the function was called, and returns either True or False. Lines 20 
through 28 define the GetString function that will allocate a memory segment (line 25), 
initialze the memory segment to a string value (line 26), and return a pointer to this 
memory segment (line 27). The function also prints a string to the screen in line 23 to 
indicate that the function was called.
Lines 30 through 33 set the variables to their default values. Line 36 shows how to 
return a literal value from the Iif function. Since the #define statement will replace the 
True and False with the defined literal values, this works in the same manner as typing in 
-1 and 0 into the Iif function. Line 40 shows the Iif function using variables as the return 
values. Line 44 illustarates using Iif with function calls for the return values. Line 48 
illustrates how to return a pointer to a string. Notice that Null is returned in the False part 
of the Iif function; this is to prevent using a null pointer in the program, since you can 
check the return value against the Null to be sure that the pointer was properly 
initialized. Lines Lines 49 through 52 check to see if myZString contains a valid pointer 
assignment and then prints the string value using the pointer index method in line 50. 
Line 51 deallocates the memory segment, although in this instance it isn't really 
necessary, as the memory segment will automatically be deallocated when the program 
ends. However, it is a good reminder that if you were using this function within a 
program, such as a loop, you would want to deallocate the memory segment when you 
finished using it. Good memory management is a good habit that you cultivate.
226


When you run the program you should see the following output.

IIF&nbsp;with&nbsp;values:&nbsp;0
IIF&nbsp;with&nbsp;variables:&nbsp;0
&lt;In&nbsp;function&nbsp;ResultTrue.&gt;
IIF&nbsp;with&nbsp;functions:­1
&lt;In&nbsp;function&nbsp;GetString.&gt;
Here&nbsp;is&nbsp;a&nbsp;string.
Output 16.3: Output of iif.bas

As you can see from the example program, the Iif function has a lot of flexibility. 
Being able to return a function value allows you to extend the functionality to strings and 
composite types, which you cannot do with the basic format of the function.
The Select Case Statement Block
The Select Case block can be viewed as an optimized if ladder, and works in much 
the same way. The standard Select&nbsp;Case can use any of the standard data types for 
&lt;expression&gt; and the specialized Select&nbsp;Case&nbsp;As&nbsp;Const format is optimized for integer 
values.

Select&nbsp;Case&nbsp;&lt;expression&gt;
Case&nbsp;&lt;list&gt;
&lt;statement&gt;&nbsp;
&lt;statement&gt;
...
Case&nbsp;Else
&lt;statement&gt;
&lt;statement&gt;
...
End&nbsp;Select

This code snippet shows the syntax of the standard select case. Expression is 
usually a variable which can be of any of the standard data types, or individual elements 
of a Type or array. The &lt;list&gt; clause of the Case statement can be any of the following 
formats.

? Case &lt;value&gt;: Value is one of the supported data types or an enumeration.
? Case &lt;value&gt; To &lt;value&gt;: Specifies a range of values.
? Case Is &lt;operator&gt; &lt;value&gt;: Operator is any of the logical operators listed in 
Table 17.1.
? Case &lt;value&gt;, &lt;value&gt;, ...: List of values separated with commas.
     227


? Case &lt;variable&gt;: A variable that contains a value.

Select&nbsp;Case&nbsp;As&nbsp;Const&nbsp;&lt;integer_expression&gt;
Case&nbsp;&lt;list&gt;
&lt;statement&gt;&nbsp;
&lt;statement&gt;
...
Case&nbsp;Else
&lt;statement&gt;
&lt;statement&gt;
...
End&nbsp;Select

The Select Case As Const is a faster version of the Select statement designed to 
work with integer expressions in the range of 0 to 4097. The &lt;list&gt; statement formats for 
the Select Case As Const are limited to values or enumerations of values. That is, the 
operator expressions are not allowed within a Case As Const.
When a Case block is executed, the statements following the Case keyword up to 
the next Case keyword (o End Select) will be executed. Only one block of statements 
within a Case will execute at any one time. If a Case Else is present, then the statements 
within the Else block will execute if no Case matches the &lt;expression&gt; portion of the 
Select statement. The following program illustrates using the Select Case statement 
block.

Listing 16.4: selectcase.bas
228


Analysis: Line 4 declares an integer value that will be used to capture the ascii 
codes in the Do-Loop block. Line 7 opens the Do-Loop block. Line 8 uses the Inkey and 
Asc functions to return the ascii code of a key press. Lines 9 through 16 define the Select 
Case As Const block. Line 9 uses the variable keycode as the expression for the select 
case. Line 10 checks to see if the keycode variable is between 48 and 57 inclusive, and if 
True will execute the code in line 11. Line 12 checks to see if the ascii code falls in the 
upper case letter range and if True, will execute line 13. Line 14 checks the lower case 
letter range and executes line 15 if True. Line 16 closes the Select Case block.
Sleep is used in line 17 to allow other process to run while this program is running. 
Line 18 checks to see if the keycode variable contains 27, the ascii code for the Escape 
key, and exits the loop if True. The program is then closed in the usual way.

When you run the program you should see something similar to the following.

You&nbsp;pressed&nbsp;an&nbsp;upper&nbsp;case&nbsp;letter&nbsp;key.
You&nbsp;pressed&nbsp;an&nbsp;upper&nbsp;case&nbsp;letter&nbsp;key.
You&nbsp;pressed&nbsp;a&nbsp;lower&nbsp;case&nbsp;key.
You&nbsp;pressed&nbsp;a&nbsp;lower&nbsp;case&nbsp;key.
You&nbsp;pressed&nbsp;a&nbsp;number&nbsp;key.
You&nbsp;pressed&nbsp;a&nbsp;number&nbsp;key.
Listing 16.5: Output of selectcase.bas

You wil notice that when the program runs, only one Case statement is executed at 
any one time. If you have used C, then the Select Case is like the Switch statement, but 
with implicit break statements within each Case block. Since only one Case block will 
execute, you cannot have fall-through situations like you have in C.

The&nbsp;purpose&nbsp;of&nbsp;this&nbsp;License&nbsp;is&nbsp;to&nbsp;make&nbsp;a&nbsp;manual,&nbsp;textbook,&nbsp;or&nbsp;other
functional&nbsp;and&nbsp;useful&nbsp;document&nbsp;"free"&nbsp;in&nbsp;the&nbsp;sense&nbsp;of&nbsp;freedom:&nbsp;to

with&nbsp;or&nbsp;without&nbsp;modifying&nbsp;it,&nbsp;either&nbsp;commercially&nbsp;or&nbsp;noncommercially.
Secondarily,&nbsp;this&nbsp;License&nbsp;preserves&nbsp;for&nbsp;the&nbsp;author&nbsp;and&nbsp;publisher&nbsp;a&nbsp;way

We&nbsp;have&nbsp;designed&nbsp;this&nbsp;License&nbsp;in&nbsp;order&nbsp;to&nbsp;use&nbsp;it&nbsp;for&nbsp;manuals&nbsp;for&nbsp;free
software,&nbsp;because&nbsp;free&nbsp;software&nbsp;needs&nbsp;free&nbsp;documentation:&nbsp;a&nbsp;free
program&nbsp;should&nbsp;come&nbsp;with&nbsp;manuals&nbsp;providing&nbsp;the&nbsp;same&nbsp;freedoms&nbsp;that&nbsp;the
software&nbsp;does.&nbsp;&nbsp;But&nbsp;this&nbsp;License&nbsp;is&nbsp;not&nbsp;limited&nbsp;to&nbsp;software&nbsp;manuals;

18 Appendix B: Setting Up FreeBasic Under Microsoft 
Windows
The first step in programming in FreeBasic is to download the compiler package 
and install it. You can skip this section if you already have FreeBasic installed on your 
system.
You can find the current version at http://www.freebasic.net/. At the time of this 
writing, the current stable version of FreeBasic is .17b. The instructions presented here 
are for the current version. Later versions may have a different installation method so be 
sure to read the included documentation before installing the package. Click on the 
download link on the main page of the FreeBasic website and select the Windows stable 
version. You will be presented with a list of download mirrors. Select the site closest to 
you (which will download faster) and save the file to a known location of your hard drive.
The filename should be FreeBASIC-v0.17b-win32.exe, or something similar. Double 
click this file to run the setup program. Click Next on the first screen, read through the 
license on the second screen and click the Accept button. FreeBasic is licensed under 
version 2 of the Gnu General Public License5.  The third screen allows you select the files 
that will be installed. For the purposes of the book, be sure to install all libraries by 
clicking on the Libraries check box until you see a green check mark, as illustrated in 
Figure 1.1.

5&nbsp;See the Free Software Foundation’s GNU website http://www.gnu.org/copyleft/gpl.html for details of the GPL 
license.
     237


You also want to make sure the examples are installed as well as the libraries, 
since there is a wealth of information to be gleaned from the provided examples. Click 
Next to select the location where you want to install the package and then click Next 
again to select where you want to place the shortcuts on your system menu and then 
click Install.

The setup program will install the files. This may take some time depending on the 
speed of your computer. Once all the files have been installed click finish. If the Run 
FreeBasic checkbox is checked, then a command window will open in the FreeBasic folder.

Figure 18.1: Library Installation


Installing FBIde
Unlike QuickBasic, FreeBasic does not have a built-in editor, so a third party editor 
must be used to create programs. Any text-based editor can be used and there are many 
free programmers’ editors available on the Internet. FBIde is an editor specifically 
designed to be used with FreeBasic and is the editor used for all the programs in this 
book. If you do not have FBIde already installed, then you must download the editor from 
the FBIde website located at http://www.fbide.freebasic.net.
Click on the download link and select the FBIde installer download link. Select the 
download mirror nearest to your location, for a faster download, and save the file to a 
known location on your hard drive. At the time of this writing, the current version of FBIde 
is 0.4.6 and the filename should FBIde_0.4.6.exe or something similar.
Double click the file to install the editor. Click Next on the first screen and make 
sure the “I accept the agreement” radio button is checked and click Next. Select the 
folder to install the editor. To make things easier, install FBIde in the folder where you 
installed FreeBasic. Click the Next button. Select the menu shortcut location, and again 
you should group the FBIde shortcut with the FreeBasic shortcut created earlier and click 
Next. The next screen allows you to install desktop shortcuts and associate *.bas and *.bi 
files with FBIde. If FreeBasic is the only basic compiler you are using, then it is convenient 
to associate these files with FBIde. If FreeBasic isn’t the only basic compiler you have, 
then you might not want to associate the files. Click the Next button and the final screen 
will be displayed. Click the install button.
Once the files have been installed click the Finish button. If the Launch Application 
check box is checked, FBIde will be started. The ide executable is called fbide.exe and 
should be in the main install folder.
Setting Up FBIde
In order to create FreeBasic programs with FBIde, the ide will need to know the 
location of the compiler. Start FBIde and select View-&gt;Settings from the main menu. 
Select the FreeBasic tab and make sure the Compiler Path textbox is pointing to the 
FreeBasic compiler, fbc.exe as illustrated in Figure 1.2.

     239


Figure 18.2: Setting the path to the FB compiler

Your setup will be different depending on where you installed FreeBasic, but should 
look similar to the above example. Once the path is setup, you are ready to compile your 
first program.
Compiling Your First Program
This is a good time to test the installation to make sure everything is set up 
correctly. Start FBIde, if it isn’t already running, enter the following code into the editor 
and save the code as helloworld.bas.

1

3
4
5

Option&nbsp;Explicit
Cls
Print&nbsp;"Hello&nbsp;World&nbsp;From&nbsp;FreeBasic!"
Sleep
End
Listing 18.1: helloworld.bas

Analysis: Line 1 is a compiler directive that tells the compiler each variable should 
be declared with the Dim statement. This program doesn't contain any variables, but it is 
a good habit to always use Option Explicit in your programs. The Cls statement in line 2 
clears the console screen. The Print statement in line will print the string “Hello World 
From FreeBasic” at the current cursor position. The Sleep statement in line 4 pauses the 
program and waits for a key press. The End statement in line 5 ends the program.
FreeBasic is a true compiler, which means that the code must be converted to an 
executable before you can run the program. Using FBIde however, the process is quite 
240


transparent. After typing in the above code click on the green arrow on the toolbar, 
circled in yellow in Figure 1.3.

Figure 18.3: Running a FreeBasic Program

If there are no errors in the program, clicking this button will compile and run the 
program resulting in the output. This is an example of a console program which uses a 
text mode window to display content. Most of the programs in this book are console 
mode programs, with the exception of the graphics programs.

FreeBasic does not have a built-in GUI interface. It relies on third-party libraries such as 
the Windows SDK, GTK or wxWidgets. This allows the programmer to pick the GUI 
interface that best meets the needs of the program, and since many of the GUI libraries 
are cross-platform, will allow GUI programs to run on several operating systems.

Hello&nbsp;World&nbsp;from&nbsp;FreeBasic!
Output 18.1: helloworld.bas

Press any key to exit the program. If you see the above screen, everything is set 
up correctly and you are ready to begin writing FreeBasic programs. If you get an error 
message, make sure that you have typed in the code exactly as listed, and that you have 
entered the correct path to the compiler in the compiler settings.
Additional Resources
In addition to this book, there are several resources on the Internet that you can 
use for any questions you may have on installing FreeBasic or on writing programs. You 
can see the current list of resources at the support page of the FreeBasic website, 
http://www.freebasic.net.. The FreeBasic community is a generous bunch and are willing 
to help newcomers over the first hurtles of programming.

Introduction to FBIde
FBIde is an Open Source ide for FreeBasic written by Albert Varaksin. At the time of 
this writing, FBIde is at version 0.4.6. You should check the FBIde website, 
http://fbide.freebasic.net/, to see if there are newer versions of the software. This 
introduction is based on 0.4.6; so later versions may be different.
General Settings
The first task is to set up the FBIde environment. Select View -&gt; Settings from the 
main menu. You should see the General Settings tab displayed as in Figure 2.1.

Figure 18.4: General Settings Dialog

Make sure that your settings are the same as Figure 2.1 for the purposes of this 
chapter and click the OK button. You can always change them later as you develop your 
method of working.
The best way to understand how FBIde works is to look at an example program. 
Start FBIde and type in the following program. Do not type in the line numbers as they 
are only provided as reference. Don’t worry about the details of the program. This is just 
an example to illustrate some of the features of FBIde.

'GetHello&nbsp;function
Function&nbsp;GetHello()&nbsp;as&nbsp;String
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Return&nbsp;"Hello&nbsp;World&nbsp;from&nbsp;FreeBasic!"
End&nbsp;Function
Listing 18.2: helloworld2.bas

Analysis: Once again the program is started with Option Explicit in line 1. The 
Declare statement in line 2 tells the compiler that a function GetHello is somewhere in 
the program. The declaration statement allows you to reference a function before the 
compiler has compiled the code for the function. In line 3 a string variable has been 
declared using the Dim statement. When the compiler sees the Dim statement, it will 
allocate memory based on the data type. Line 4 is an example of a comment. A comment 
starts with the ' (single quote) character and continues to the end of the line. The Cls 
statement in line 5 will clear the console screen. In line 7 the string variable previously 
declared is set the value of the function, GetHello which returns a string value. In line 9 
the contents of the string variable are printed to the string. Line 11 through 13 pause the 
program and wait for a key press.
The function GetHello that was declared in line 2 is defined in lines 15 through 17. 
The keyword Function indicates that this procedure will return a value, using the Return 
statement in line 16. Each function must be closed with the End Function keywords 
shown in line 17.
You should frequently save your work while working on your programs. A lot of 
unexpected things can happen, and if for some reason the computer shuts down or you 
lose power, you can easily lose hours of work. Table 2.1 shows the File functions in FBIde. 
The shortcut keys show the key combination required to invoke the functions. For 
example, to invoke Undo you would hold down the Ctrl key while pressing the Z key. All 
the short-cut keys work in the same fashion. Learning the short-cut keys will save 
valuable time during the editing process.

Table 18.1: File Functions

Most Recent Used Files List
The list of files under the Quit menu option is the MRU or most recently used file 
list. Selecting a file from the list will load the file into the editor.
Syntax Highlighting
After typing in the program, FBIde should look similar to Figure 2.2.

244


Figure 18.5: FBIde with HelloWorld2.bas loaded

The first thing you will notice is that the keywords are highlighted in different 
colors. This is a visual aid to help indicate the correct spelling of the keywords, data types 
as well as to indicate data items. You can change the color scheme by selecting View -&gt; 
Settings from the main menu and selecting the Theme tab.
Themes
There are several predefined themes that you can select by clicking on the Theme 
drop-down box as shown in Figure 2.3. You can also create your own theme by selecting 
Create New Theme from Theme drop-down, selecting the language elements from the 
Type list box, selecting the desired Foreground and Background colors for the selected 
element, as well as the font characteristics for the language element. Click on the Save 
Theme button to save the theme for later use.

     245


 Figure 18.6: Theme Settings

Keywords
In order to colorize the keywords, FBIde contains keyword group lists under the 
Keywords tab of the settings dialog as shown in Figure 2.4.

246


Figure 18.7: Keyword Settings

FreeBasic is in continual development, and a new version of the compiler may 
come out ahead of the FBIde updates. If new keywords are added to the language, you 
can add them here so that they will be colorized in the editor.
Tabbed Interface
FBIde uses a tabbed interface so you can load more than one file at a time. For 
large projects, it is a good idea to break up your program into different modules, and 
each loaded module will have a tab and workspace of its own. The current active file will 
be the highlighted tab.
Line Numbers
The numbers in the left margin are line numbers and are provided for reference. If 
there is an error in your program and it won’t compile correctly, you will see an error 
message and line number in the result window. FBIde will also position the cursor on the 
offending line. Figure 2.5 shows the result window with an error displayed.

     247


Figure 18.8: Result window showing an error
Results Window
The result window indicates line number in the Line column, the current file in the 
File column, the error number returned by the compiler in the Error Nr column, and the 
corresponding error message in the Message column, along with the offending piece of 
code. You will notice that the cursor has been placed on the correct line in the editor.
If you look at the bottom right panel in Figure 2.5 you will see a 7: 1. This indicates 
that the cursor is currently on line 7 and column 1.
Subroutine and Function Folding
If you look at line 15 in Figure 2.5 you will see a small white box next to the line 
number. This is the subroutine and function folding handle. Click on the box and the code 
for the subroutine will collapse and clicking again on the box will display the code. If your 
program has a number of subroutines or functions, this is a handy way to keep the 
workspace a bit less cluttered.
Folding is based on the indentation of your program and not the keywords. If you 
do not indent your program you will not see any folding handles.
248


Save File Indicator
Notice in Figure 2.5 that there is an asterisk next to the filename in the highlighted 
tab. This indicates that the file has not yet been saved.
Quit Tab Select and Close Tab
If you have a lot of files open, you may not be able to fit all the tabs on the screen, 
as illustrated in Figure 2.6.

Figure 18.9: Multiple files open

The small downward pointing arrow to the right of the tab list is the quick tab 
select. Clicking on this arrow will display a list of loaded files. Selecting a file from the list 
will make that tab active. Next to the down arrow are left and right arrows that will scroll 
left and right through the tab list. The X will close the current file in the selected tab.
Editing and Format Functions
The editor supports all the standard editing and search functions under the Edit 
and Search menu items.  Table 2.2 shows all the editing and search functions.

Table 18.2: Editing Functions
Block Comment-Uncomment
One nice feature of the ide the block comment, uncomment that you will find 
under the Edit menu. Highlight one or more lines of code, select Edit -&gt; Comment Block 
to convert the code to comments. This will add the comment marker ‘ at the front of the 
code. Select Edit -&gt; Uncomment Block to remove the comments. This is very handy if you 
want to add notes to the program, or comment out lines of code.
FBIde also has a built-in code formatter that you can find under View -&gt; Format on 
the main menu.

250


Figure 18.10: Auto-format options

As you can see there are a number of format options, including HTML and BBCode 
that is used in many popular forums.
Bracket Matching
Another nice feature of FBIde is the Highlight Matching Braces setting in the 
Settings dialog. Move the cursor to the left of a parenthesis, and the matching 
parenthesis will be highlighted in the theme color, as illustrated in Figure 2.8.

Figure 18.11: Example of editor showing matching 
parenthesis

This is very useful when working with complex expressions to make sure that all 
the parentheses are balanced correctly.

     251


Subroutine and Function Browser
In large programs finding the correct subroutine or function can sometimes be 
difficult, but FBIde has a function browser, which simplifies the task. The function browser 
is shown in Figure 2.9.

Figure 18.12: Function browser

Press F2 to show or hide the browser. The browse tree is shown in Figure 2.8. 
Selecting the S/F List tab, will display the function and subroutine names in a list format. 
Double-clicking on a function name in the list will display the function in the editor. The 
Browse Files tab displays an Explorer style file list to browse files on your hard drive.
As you can see in the Tree list, not only does the browser display subroutines and 
functions, it will also list types, unions and enumerations, which will be covered later in 
the book.
Running Programs and Creating Executables
The Run menu item has a number of options available for running and creating 
executables. Table 2.3 explains the meaning of the various menu items.

Table 18.3: Run Menu Items
Adding an Icon to Your Program
When you create an executable you will notice that the EXE file has the rather 
bland, standard windows executable icon. You can add a custom icon to your application 
by using a resource file. Create a new file in FBIde by selecting File -&gt; New or clicking the 
New icon on the toolbar. Enter the following line of text into the editor window.
FB_PROGRAM_ICON&nbsp;ICON&nbsp;hw.ico
Save the file as hw.rc in the same folder as HelloWorld2.bas and close the file. You 
will need an icon file in the same folder as the rc file with the file name hw.ico. Load 
HelloWorld2.bas if it isn’t already loaded. Select View -&gt; Settings from the main menu 
and select the FreeBasic tab on the settings dialog. 

     253


Figure 18.13: Adding an rc File to the Compiler Commands

In the Compiler Command text field add hw.rc after the "&lt;$fbc&gt;" "&lt;$file&gt;" text 
string and click the OK button. It should look similar to Figure 2.10. Now compile the 
program and look in the program folder. The executable now has the custom icon you 
selected rather than the standard windows icon.

Caution If you forget to remove the hw.rc after compiling your program, and 
try to compile a different program in a different folder, you will see an error similar to 
“Unable to open source file (hw.RC). OBJ file not made.” Just remove the resource file 
reference from the compiler command text box in the settings dialog and the new 
program will compile correctly.

FreeBasic Help File
You will notice in Figure 2.9 that there is a help file field. You can download a help 
file for FreeBasic in CHM format from the downloads page of the FreeBasic website. This 
is a snapshot of the FreeBasic documentation wiki located at the url: 
http://www.freebasic.net/wiki/wikka.php?FBWiki. The help file may not be as current as 
the wiki, but it is useful to have for working off line.
Copy the help file to the folder where you installed FreeBasic and point FBIde to 
this file. Use the button to the left of the Help File text field to browse the location. Once 
the help file has been set, selecting Help -&gt; from the main menu will load display the 
help file.
You can also get context-sensitive help for a keyword by placing the cursor on the 
keyword and pressing F1.
